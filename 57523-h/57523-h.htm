<h2>FOREWORD<br />
<small>THE REASON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>These chats are the pleasurable results of
the many little confidential ones I have given
at boys’ and young men’s clubs and at preparatory
schools.</p>

<p>It has been my fortune—for so I consider
it—to have been brought into intimate relations
with men who are failures. Not the down and
out men, but those who are struggling along
dissatisfied with what they are doing—what
false and wrong training has forced them to do.</p>

<p>Many of these despondent and useless men
have been guided into places where they fit—where
there is conservation of energy, happiness
and results. These are the factors for a
mentally and physically balanced man—provided
he has had early instruction in some
vital matters.</p>

<p>The impulse to have the future fathers in
a position to guide and live in close confidential
relations with their sons, is the reason for this
book.</p>

<p>Professional experience has proven to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
complete satisfaction that the many failures,
misfits, despondents and diseased in our present
generation were not fundamentally ill fitted
to battle with life, but that they had never
been started right, physically, mentally, vocationally.</p>

<p>Physical instructors built muscle, teachers
forced much useful and also useless stuff into
unwilling brain cells, fathers furnished the
money—as a rule I find that this latter was
about all the parents did furnish; and thought
this all-sufficient.</p>

<p>The results have been deplorable. Wasted
energies, disgust for study in lines that never
appealed, misdirected powers, and exhausted
vigor is what I have daily seen for twenty-five
years.</p>

<p>And most of these conditions are avoidable.</p>

<p>How frequently have I heard the remark,
after explaining to a young man who came
to me a complete failure: “Why didn’t my
father see all this?” or “I wanted to do that,
Doctor, but they said that I didn’t know my
own mind; so they made me study things that
I hated.” Then the vital facts which every boy
should early have confidentially and chummily
told him:—“Oh, Doctor, if I had only known
these things ten years ago! What a different
man I would be to-day!”</p>

<p>Yes, and your sons can benefit from your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
experience, for it has forced me to “chat” with
them in these pages.</p>

<p>My plan as outlined is to give the boy and
youth the information which will enable him
to conserve his energies, increase his vigor and
learn just what his mental endowment and
powers are. Then to concentrate upon these
constantly, allowing deviations only so far as
they broaden the horizon surrounding his vocation.</p>

<p>There also is much to say upon physical
conservation—the storing of physical vigor
which in emergencies can be called upon without
injury to the working capital. This vital
matter has seldom been touched in the training
of our youths; and as men we find them working
up to the last degree of power and when
the call comes for extra power there is none—the
man then goes to the human dump pile.
There is no excuse for this sad state of affairs—the
cause is ignorance of man’s vital resources
and how to conserve them.</p>

<p>Boys, I have been a repairer of human
machines all my life; machines sent out on the
road not properly adjusted, they have been
returned to my shop, and with most of them
I could only point out certain parts which
were weak and let them go again, taking care
not to put too great a strain on these parts.</p>

<p>Now I want you all to start out with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
part—brain, body and soul—equally adjusted,
all of the same strong material, well fitted
to work in peace, happiness and health—these
factors working in harmony means success—no
matter what line you take up for life’s work.</p>

<small>THE BODY AS A MACHINE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Any young man who understands the simple
facts concerning his body and the laws of
human energy, should be able to be as strong
in body and nerves at fifty as he is at twenty-five
years of age.</p>

<p>If he is strong in body and nerves at fifty
he has the increased brain power of experience
and work, and only think of the force he has
then to utilize for the next twenty years.</p>

<p>This is a practical idea and not a theory or
a statement of exceptional cases.</p>

<p>But if this is so, why have not our parents
been able to be boys with us instead of old men
at fifty? Because they did not understand;
never had the plain points shown them; physicians
have not always considered this side of
boyhood development, and because physiology
as taught in the public schools was not that
physiology needed by youths and boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall not here bother with the old style
and schoolbook physiology. I am going to
present to you the simple, common-sense facts
about the body and how it must be handled to
get the best out of it.</p>

<p>If you have an automobile, the first thing
you do is to understand it; its different working
parts, how they are dependent upon each
other, how much fuel is needed and how
applied, what will make the engine run
smoothly, what will injure it and what kind of
usage is necessary to keep it always in good
running order, what will cause it to break down
and become an old rattling thing and send it
to the scrap heap.</p>

<p>The finest built machine is of no value if any
of the parts which have gone into it are faulty;
it will break down when a strain comes. It is
just so with man; for when you really come
to understand the machinery within you, you
will realize that you are the most delicate and
at the same time toughest piece of mechanism
ever produced. Muscular power, brain force,
will, mental ability, all depend upon the
PHYSICAL condition of man—the parts and
condition of the machine in him.</p>

<p>The higher power in us that makes the human
body a mere medium for development we shall
not here say much about, but so related is it
to the body itself, that a poorly adjusted or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
diseased body will affect this higher power,
the soul, the conscience, the morals of the man.
That is, a diseased or weak body—not merely
muscular weakness, but a general weakness
due to neglect of nature’s laws—will show a
weak will, a lack of determination and a further
falling away from a high moral standard—in
other words make a failure of a man.</p>

<p>But why should this be so? Is man to be
blamed for being physically weak, to be punished
because he has not that full strength of
body that others have? Yes; I think so. But
suppose he inherits a weak body, inherits disease?
Is he to be blamed for something over
which he has no control? Not exactly that,
for there <em>is only one disease you can inherit</em>,
and that is a punishment for your parents’ or
grandparents’ sins—or in most cases, ignorance.</p>

<p>When you thoroughly understand your own
body, the little <em>tendencies</em> to weakness or predisposition
to certain diseases can all be overcome.
The distressing effects of venereal diseases
seen in children whose parents have been
ignorant of the facts you will be given in this
book, have been a blessing to mankind, insomuch
as you can all avoid them after the
knowledge concerning them and your body is
yours.</p>

<p>You see, what I mean is that you will possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
knowledge your parents did not possess. In
such a grand position the future men and
women—your children—will be started right.
And so will you if you heed and absorb what I
shall tell you.</p>

<p>Big muscles do not necessarily mean strength,
but to be strong one must have well developed
muscles.</p>

<p>Seems an odd statement; doesn’t it?</p>

<p>A man may inherit big bones to which are
attached big muscles. The fibres of these muscles
may be coarse, inelastic and under control
of a slow motor—a sluggish nervous system.
Just as you may have a big motor car, big
frames and running gear, but under-powered.</p>

<p>Now remember that all real muscular power
originates in the nervous system and brain.
If the nervous system and brain are not in
perfect condition, the full power of the muscles
can never be utilized any more than you
can get the full power out of your big car if
the cylinders are too small or so weak in construction
that you do not dare to run them at
full speed.</p>

<p>This is one reason why men born with big
frames and large muscles are not always the
strong men. Frequently these men break
down in the prime of life. Also during their
active lives they really never get all their
power in use. I consider such men unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in that they do not possess the knowledge of
their condition, so they neglect in early life
the necessary rules and habits which, if heeded
would bring them to old age in full possession
of their natural strength.</p>

<p>The weakling who realizes his failings and
knows how to correct and care for them, is
more often the strong and healthy man in
middle and later life. This fact teaches us
one of the great laws of nature; that is that we
cannot for a day neglect our body; the born
strong man does, he never watches or cleans
his big machine—it goes to rust and wears out
in parts.</p>

<p>These strong men as youths, from the mere
fact of having big, hawser-like muscles controlled
by a slow-moving force, do not have
the incentive to build up active muscles nor
the energy to train the nervous mechanism
controlling muscular activity. The result is
that such a man’s muscles remain coarse fibered,
fatty, bulky, and respond slowly to the motor
centers of the brain. Moreover, they feel in
such perfect health that they are careless about
their habits and throw away a lot of energy
that the man who is building up strength takes
care of—saves for future use and material.</p>

<p>A youth who desires to build muscular
strength goes about it carefully and slowly.
Remember that all staying powers, brain or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
muscle, must be built up slowly. The tough
and hardy oak does not grow like the weak
poplar—quickly. Its growth is steady, regular
and slow, but in the end it is powerful,
long lived and richly reproductive. Make
haste slowly is one of the fundamental laws of
nature.</p>

<p>Brain and nervous system always come first
in starting to build muscular power that is to
last and be always at your command. The
basis of power depends upon the rapidity with
which the muscles respond to mental impulses.
Properly developed muscles are finely-fibered,
and react instantly to the impulse of the motor
cells of the brain—the cells which tell the muscles
to shoot out at once. Now let anything
such as alcohol, tobacco, loss of sleep or immoral
habits, fasten on the youth and all
attempts to get the full strength out of muscles,
no matter how big they are, will be useless.
The reason is that the brain cells have been
affected—they cannot act as they should and
so the muscles cannot respond to the impulse.
This is the cause of so many first-class boxers
taking the final count. Success has made them
careless; they neglect the rules of the physiologic
game, they drink a little, smoke and indulge
in other habits which affect their nervous
system. They go on the stage breathing the
foul and poisonous atmosphere while exhibiting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
are necessarily late to bed and while still keeping
up their MUSCULAR training neglect
the fact that every day they are injuring their
nervous motility. It is so little noticed that
no attention is paid to the matter. But when
it comes to a battle after such a career—even
if careful training has been done weeks before
the contest—the effect is shown, and down the
champion goes before a less experienced boxer,
one not so strong in the muscles but one whose
full brain and nervous force has remained uncontaminated.
Then, sad to relate, THIS
champion goes the same way.</p>

<p>So you see that mere gross muscular structure
is valueless—except it is needed for daily
labor, where it exists as mere animal automatism—unless
it is under the immediate control
of a highly-organized nervous system free
from disease and abuse.</p>

<p>So delicate is this nervous element of the
body in getting the muscles to respond, that
I have tested hundreds of athletes—including
myself—by a very sensitive instrument which
shows the response of the muscles to the condition
of the brain cells. A youth who has lived
a perfect life—physiologically speaking—is
kept from one half of his night’s sleep. The
next day he is tested and there is a difference
shown in the rapidity of muscular response.
The difference in a tenth of a second in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a blow makes all the difference between a
champion and a loser, and this tenth of a second
can be brought about by the loss of one night’s
rest. How must it be then when the youth
has lost several, or been breathing foul air
with heavily working lungs?</p>

<p>The extreme muscular development seen in
those who pose on the stage and before the
camera, while marvelous to the sight, is in
reality of little practical use. Such muscles
are not developed through normal exercises,
but gain their prominence by being contracted
and expanded through mental concentration on
the muscle itself, not on any work that the muscle
should be made to perform. Under this
fad form of “physical culture” the levers
which the muscles should lift and lower are
kept immovable, the muscles themselves do no
work, the fibers only being caused to swell
and shrink.</p>

<p>Take the “development” of the biceps, for
instance. This muscle is intended to flex the
forearm, attachments being on the upper arm
and shoulder and the insertions in the upper
part of the lower arm, making a perfect leverage.
Now, in this false “physical culture”
system the arm is held semi-flexed and rigid
and the muscle made to rise and fall, no tension
being put upon its attachments. The
result is a development of the center of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
muscle, but a development of a mere shape, not
the development of the power of lifting. The
attachments are not developed or strengthened;
they remain thin; hence, to the spectator
in the audience, the center of the bulking
mass of biceps looms up as a powerful
organ of force—it is simply an artificial
lump.</p>

<p>This false method of “physical culture”
also squeezes out the little amount of fat that
the muscle should bed in for ease and nourishment,
and this further accentuates its size
when illumined by a spot light against a black
background.</p>

<p>Big chests do not necessarily mean big
lung power, but one must have a capacious
chest to have great lung power.</p>

<p>Another odd statement? Not exactly.</p>

<p>The average man does not use in daily work
much more than half his lung power-capacity.
There remain in the lower portion of his lungs
thousands of little air cells, which stay practically
closed in ordinary breathing. When
a man is called upon to run a long distance he
soon finds himself in distress, has “a stitch
in his side.” This slight pain is caused by the
effort made by the air to get into these closed
cells. It is the forcing open of these reserve
cells that produces the “stitch in the side.”
When these cells become active and take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the extra air needed, the distress ceases and the
man gets his “second wind.”</p>

<p>Now, it can readily be seen that the greater
the chest capacity the greater the reserve force.
As it is in the muscle of the “physical culture”
man so it is in the chest development of the
same class—an unnatural condition. These
latter possess, by constant deep breathing,
forcibly inhaling and exhaling, a large chest.
But there is no reserve force; all the cells are
constantly filled. The chest development is
good to look upon, but we must remember that
the owner of such a chest has no reserve
power—no extra breathing space to call upon
when most needed. He has reached his limit
at the start—a condition fatal to athletic work.
A condition injurious to the man’s future
health, for there are many times in illness
and in emergencies when he will need some
reserve force to fall back upon. It is like
taking a journey and spending all your money
at the start—when you need some, it is not
there.</p>

<p>Athletes are healthy, not because they are
athletes, but because all healthy individuals
are athletes; not necessarily competitors in
games or strivers after honors, but persons
who enjoy outdoor living and breathing the
fresh red-blood giving air.</p>

<p>But there are so many mistakes made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
youths and boys who strive to become athletes
before their body machinery is properly adjusted,
that much harm has been done by overtraining
and a misunderstanding of what really
constitutes a healthy man.</p>

<p>Americans have absorbed much of the energy
in the world, but not all its wisdom. Too many
of our athletic instructors at the schools have
tried to turn out athletes instead of strong men
and women.</p>

<p>When we read in the daily papers of the
collapse of a celebrated athlete, or the breaking
down during training of a young aspirant for
honors on the cinder path, we naturally surmise
that fundamental knowledge of the physiology
of the muscular mechanism of the human
body is either submerged by the overpowering
desire to make a record or is totally absent
among certain trainers and their pupils.</p>

<p>The want of wisdom concerning man and
his body is the cause of many sad conditions
existing to-day among formerly strong and
healthy young men. A comprehensive idea
of the physiology of growth, of the physiologic
and chemic relations of strength and endurance
to age and condition, would be of great value
to a large number of old individuals—not old
in years, but old in vessels and tissues—who
strive to put an unusual strain on their weak
arteries, as well as to the youth whose central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
nervous system is often permanently injured
by over-exertion in attempting to make records
placed by carefully trained and intelligent
athletes.</p>

<p>Let us take those Marathon runs as an example.
Two years ago I witnessed the real
Marathon—that is, the great one in this country—the
Boston event. This run is a nerve-racking,
lung-pulling one of twenty-six miles
up many steep and long hills. Among the
large number of contestants were a boy of
about sixteen and a man somewhere in the
forties.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> To allow such starters was a great
mistake—especially in the boy’s case. There
were physicians at the start to examine into
the condition of the runners, but what doctor
could tell off-hand of the past habits, inherited
faults in the bodily mechanism or system of
training these various contestants possessed?
There was only one reasonable course to take—that
is, to withhold their sanction to the starting
of those whose years had not fully developed
the bodily functions, and of those whose habits
had brought a strain on the valves of the heart.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Since my criticism and explanation in the magazines, the Committee
allow no youths under eighteen years to run in the event.</p></div>

<p>If we were all Indians, having been placed
at birth out in the open and lived without
clothes until puberty placed a loin cloth on us,
accustomed every day to run and tramp, developing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the different organs of the body
harmoniously and gradually until they all
reached their full power and held in reserve
extra power, then these runs of twenty and
more miles would not injure us. But, as it is,
they are of no benefit and in many cases injurious.
Young men who spend hours indoors,
who have worn clothing since birth, been prevented
from using the greatest breathing organ
next to the lungs,—the skin,—who train for this
event and then step back to our civilized life of
houses, furnaces, trolleys and clothing, are not
fitted for these great strains on organs which
have been unused to them.</p>

<p>The human body is a wonderful piece of
mechanism, which not only renews itself constantly,
but whose strength and endurance and
capacity for more work increase with increased
use up to the point at which use becomes
abuse. At what time and under what pressure
this danger-line is reached depends upon the
individual. However, the approach to the
danger-line is governed in all cases by fixed and
immutable laws.</p>

<p>The athlete must always bear in mind that
the length of time a muscle cell can continue
to work will depend upon the rapidity with
which the energy-holding explosive compounds
are formed by the cell protoplasm and the
waste products are secreted. In other words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the capital must not be expended at a greater
rate than it can be replaced. If it is expended
at a greater rate fatigue commences, and a
continuance of this expenditure results in
physical bankruptcy.</p>

<p>It is simply the case of the automobile over
again. To run smoothly and continuously there
must be fuel steadily supplied and the exhaust—the
waste products—cast off, leaving no residue
to clog up the engine. But you watch
your fuel tank and see that it is well supplied,
for you know the consequences if the fuel
runs out—if you run your engine up to the
last drop.</p>

<p>To use up no more fuel in the body than
the body will replace, is the secret of athletic
success. To go beyond this point means injury—often
injury that a life time can never
repair. This is one reason why sprinters who
have made records succumb early in life to
disease or ill health. They have over-heated
their human machinery, and the worn parts
can never run completely smooth again.</p>

<p>How is this fuel that is being used up in
the body replaced?</p>

<p>The muscle is continually undergoing change
of material. The minute substances which
make up the muscle, and whose very actions
keep it alive, are being constantly cast off,
fresh substances taking their place. The cast-off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
material is the fatigue poison. And it is a
poison. Inject it into a dog and he will soon
die. Without muscle rest, this dead poisonous
stuff cannot be replaced fast enough by the
new products, and the result is an impoverished
capital of force elements. This does not apply
only to the muscle in active use up to this
point, but to all muscles of the body.</p>

<p>The energy products of the food are delivered
up to the muscle by the blood, and
this fluid picks up and carries away the cast-off
substances of the muscle. These fatigue products
are only <em>gradually</em> eliminated from the
blood.</p>

<p>In the youth these poisonous products are
cast off much more rapidly than in the full
grown man. Also they are not so rapidly
manufactured. But right here lies a danger
point—the youth is not warned in time and
often goes beyond the point where the off-castings
are entirely eliminated and some remain
stored up in his system. Then his nervous
system suffers and the trouble goes on unrecognized
until it is too late.</p>

<p>Another thing may happen. In the youth
the fatigue poison may be thrown off quicker
than the good material can take its place,
hence such an athlete—generally a runner—will
fall from sheer exhaustion of the muscular
mechanism—perhaps ruined for life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>To keep on the right side of the danger-line
in exercise, the muscle must have short
intervals of rest. Nature so well understood
the proneness of man not to heed advice that
she placed the action of one muscle beyond his
control. This muscle is so constructed, internally
adjusted, that it has its regular periods
of rest, and only in disorder of the body can
its expenditure be raised beyond its means.
This great and wonderful muscle is the heart.</p>

<p>However, there are certain conditions having
their origin in the will and the excitement of
mental forces, where the heart is pushed beyond
its self-control. Such cases sometimes occur
in college boat races—the four-mile races. It
is not so much the mere muscular efforts of the
contestants as it is the intense mental excitement
accompanying the effort. No youth of a
highly-strung, nervous temperament should row
in these races—no matter what his muscular
strength is.</p>

<p>The heart, though making contractions at
the rate of seventy-two times a minute, is able
to continue its work without fatigue throughout
the life of the individual. Each contraction
of this wonderful muscle is followed by an
interval of rest, during which the cells recuperate.
Push the heart-beats to a very rapid rate
and we approach the danger-line at which
fatigue products cannot be replaced by fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
cells; the intervals of rest are not sufficient.
The same conditions exist in every muscle.
This is the reason why we often see immediate
or ultimate collapse at the finish of a four-mile
boat race or a quarter-mile run. Such a
collapse may be followed by irremediable loss
of health.</p>

<p>You should remember all through your life
that each member of the body, in the very act
of living, produces poison to itself. When this
poison accumulates faster than it can be thrown
off, which always occurs unless the muscle can
have an interval of rest, then will come fatigue,
which is only another expression for poisonous
infection—real, genuine poison. If the muscle
is given an interval of rest, so that the cell can
give off its waste product to keep pace with the
new productions, the muscle will then liberate
energy for a long time. This latter condition
is what we call endurance. When you say a
boy has long endurance it simply means that
all his organs are in perfect working order; that
they repair as soon as they waste. Such a
condition kept up means a long life and a
healthy one. And you can all obtain this
state, as I shall later on show you.</p>

<p>The power and endurance of the human
machine are limited according to our understanding
of the above facts. But another important
bit of knowledge is necessary to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
if we wish to avoid ruining our physical energy:
that is, to recognize the necessity of starting the
human machine slowly. Like any other ponderous
and intricate machine, the body requires
time to get in harmonious working order.
What would you think of an engineer who
started his engine off with a jump at high
speed? What would happen to a big engine
if the throttle were pulled wide open at the
instant of starting?</p>

<p>The brain, nerves, heart and muscles must
be given some warning of the work they are
expected, collectively, to perform. Ignorance
of this fact has broken down many a young
man who aspired to honors on the cinder-path.
The necessity of getting all the parts of the
body slowly in working order is well understood
by trainers and jockeys on the racetrack,
as is evidenced by the preliminary
“warming up” they give their horses, although
it is doubtful if the trainers could give any
physiologic reason for the custom.</p>

<p>I once asked an old darky trainer in the
South why he always ran his horses just
before a race, and he replied, “I’s got ter ile
’em up; jus’ ile ’em up.” Then he shouted to
a little bow-legged coon on a big bay horse:
“Youse, git a goin’ dar, Sam; git ’im iled up so
I kaint heer ’im squeek—git de ile in ’is jints;
go dar!” And Sam went on “iling ’im up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the substances supplied to the muscles
by the blood, oxygen is one the want of which
is soonest felt. The muscle contains within itself
a certain store of oxygen, but one which
is by no means equal to the oxidizable substances.
The muscle’s activity is dependent,
to a great extent, on the <em>character</em> and force
of the blood-flow. It must be clear of waste
products, and contain, as well, sufficient oxygen
to keep up continually a renewal of
energy.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will readily be
seen that the result of a muscular task which
an athlete wishes to perform, will depend
primarily on his muscular bulk and on the conditions
of these muscles and the rate at which
he expends his capital; the test of his endurance
will depend upon the condition of the other
parts of his body and how rapidly they will
carry off the quickly formed poisonous products
and supply fresh ones.</p>

<p>A large number of the lesser pugilists have
died in the ring the last ten years. Scarcely
one of these deaths was directly due to the
force or severity of the blows struck, but because
the fighters were “out of condition.”
The writer, himself, once had an opponent in
the amateur ring whose condition was so plainly
unfit that he refrained from exerting forceful
energy, but let the man poison himself, when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
gentle cross-counter laid him out. He literally
beat himself.</p>

<p>What I have said about self-poisoning refers
also to the nerves and brain. As the muscles
work faster, so do the central nerve cells which
send the stimulating impulses to these muscles.
These latter cells become fatigued sooner than
the muscles. This is a grand feature of
physiologic economy; for, did not this condition
exist, the muscles would work themselves
to pieces—run wild, like an uncontrolled engine.</p>

<p>The muscular differences noted in individuals
are in reality the difference in the nerve cells,
the actions of the muscles indicating the activity
of the central nervous system. When the
muscles are being exercised the nerve cells
indirectly determine the muscular activity.</p>

<p>From the above statement it can be seen
why one with exhausted nerve cells should
avoid exercise. The nervous system should be
at rest. For example; if a youth is recovering
from some severe illness—typhoid fever, let us
say—he should not at first try to get back his
muscular strength by self-exercise. The muscles
need blood sent to them to grow and regain
their former elasticity, but the nerve cells
required for all this must have a rest. How
is it to be done?</p>

<p>By the exercise of another person’s nerve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
cells. That is, the muscles should be massaged
by some strong man. As the nerve cells gradually
come to their full activity again, then
the youth may commence gradual exercises on
his own account.</p>

<p>It is the general impression among athletes
that exhaustion and “loss of wind” are due
to the inability to consume sufficient oxygen and
exhale rapidly enough carbon dioxide. When
the muscle is moving rapidly and forcibly,
it is true that it demands more oxygen and
gives off to the blood more carbon dioxide than
when at rest. When a man is running as fast
as he can make his limbs move, he is able to
keep up the pace but for a short distance,
unless, like the hunted hare, he runs to death.
On account of the forced and rapid muscular
action in this case the poisonous materials are
thrown into the blood, to be carried to all parts
of the body—muscles, nerves, brain. The
heart is affected by this poison through the
nerve cells controlling this organ; the muscles
of respiration are similarly disturbed. The
panting, distressed efforts of breathing, sidelong
tumbling and final semi-unconsciousness
of the hunted stag or hare are good examples
of acute self-poisoning ending in death. It is
just as much a case of poisoning as would be
a case of gas poisoning; the only difference
being that in the first case the gas is manufactured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in your body, in the other case, outside
and you breathe it in.</p>

<p>One of the main “clearing houses” of the
body, by which the blood is constantly cleared
of much of its poisons, is the liver. The minute
cells of this organ each have their individual
work to perform in transforming the poisonous
material into harmless substances. The cells
of this “clearing house” are delicate little organs,
and will not stand abuse. All habits
having a tendency to cause dyspepsia—eating
rapidly, eating indigestible food, constant and
intemperate use of alcohol or the use of tobacco
in the youth—disturb the normal work of the
liver. Hence, one of the first aims of a boy
who desires to be a strong man—and what boy
does not have this admirable aim?—should be
to keep the liver in the best possible condition.
Any clogging or disturbance of the ordinary
work of the liver prevents the blood from being
in a pure state. All parts of the body will
show distressing symptoms of fatigue and exhaustion
if the little cells of the liver have become
diseased or useless through intemperate
living and ignorance of the duties belonging
to each separate organ of the human body.</p>

<p>In general terms I have given you some
facts necessary to know if you wish to reach
full manhood in perfect health and with all
the organs so adjusted that the human machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in you will work the rest of your long life
without squeaking and rattling. But there are
many little details for you to know in order to
keep the adjustment perfect and to increase
the power and energy in you—mental and
physical. Too many boys and youths have
never been taught how to get the best that is
in them to work—to be a success because they
are doing what is in them to do and are happy
in doing it—this is what means success. I shall
try in the next chat to go into some of these
details, and so on up to the most important
facts in life. To give you a comprehensive
knowledge of your sex organs, how to care for
them, what Life means, and in all matters that
go to make up the normal man. To give
you instruction that makes a man, produces the
character of the man of honor, to give you the
inward grace of a gentleman, which cannot
manifest itself outwardly save in good manners,
modesty of bearing and fearlessness. And so
many of these qualities depend inwardly upon
a perfect adjustment of all your organs. You
shall be told all about differences of man and
woman; why you should be at all times kind
and considerate to the girls and women—in fact
what the world means in its development and
what you can do to assist in its better development.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE OUTSIDE LUNGS—THE SKIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I have told you that next to the lungs the
greatest breathing organ of the body is the
skin. The great importance of this fact has
been overlooked by many of your school
teachers and parents—that is, from the boy’s
standpoint.</p>

<p>It is through the skin that much of the
poison of the body is thrown off; and it is
because there are conditions in our methods
of living which prevent its full activity that
we have so much insanity of a certain form,
habits that are injurious to body and brain
and are often the cause for the boy being inattentive
to his studies and blamed by the
teacher for being lazy or stupid. He is not, in
fact, anything of the kind; he is indolent and
unable to interest himself in his work because
through his brain is flowing blood contaminated
by poisons that the skin has not been able to
cast off.</p>

<p>I think we all know about those Saturday
night’s baths. Your mother was brought up
with the impression that if you had a bath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
once a week that was sufficient. You see the
real facts were never given her. She simply
thinks of cleanliness, and once a week is enough
to get the DIRT off the ordinary boy. But
this is the OUTSIDE dirt—what you must be
careful to do is to get the <em>inside</em> dirt—poisons—out
of your system. Many an unfortunate
boy has been handicapped for life because these
poisons accumulated in his system as he grew
up and the real cause for his nervousness, restlessness
and inability to keep at one thing was
never known.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the powerful effects
of not keeping the pores of the skin so open
that every drop of the poisons being made in
the body every minute can work out. If a
healthy boy should have his body—up to his
neck—wrapped in tin foil, or any similar substance
which would completely close the pores
of the skin, he would soon have headache. This
would become very severe, followed by loss of
consciousness and finally convulsions—fits followed
by death. Now this would occur even
if he were in the open air. You can see by this
fact that the lungs cannot alone cast off the
poisons in the body; in fact their principal
work is to supply the blood with oxygen and
throw off carbonic acid gas—carbon dioxide;
the skin must get rid of much of the other
injurious material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Another important thing to remember is that
when this poisonous stuff is allowed to remain
in the body it causes a ready soil for disease
germs to grow in—typhoid fever, malaria,
pneumonia, etc. If you keep the body free
from all its poisons and have plenty of sleep,
exercise and proper food scarcely any disease
can attack you, for there are in the human body
millions of little cells which roam around devouring
all the germs of real diseases if they
dare venture into a healthy body. If this
were not so, not one of us would live out our
infancy.</p>

<p>You have heard a great many stories about
the endurance of the little Japanese, and a
lot has been said about its being due to their
custom of living on rice. This has but little
to do with their powers of endurance. Of
course a diet of rice and vegetables do not leave
in the body such an amount of poison as meat
will leave; but even when the Japanese eat meat
we witness their wonderful powers of endurance.</p>

<p>They can start on a run and keep it up all
day. But they will stop two or three times a
day and take a hot bath. Here is the secret—that
is, the principal secret. I have had one
of these little, but powerful chaps pull me in
a ’rickshaw up hills and around mountain
roads at a dog trot which tired me to watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
him; so fearful was I at first that he would
break down. But about every two hours he
would stop at a bathhouse along the roadside
and literally wash off the sweat containing the
cast-off poisons from his body. Then fresh as
when he started in the morning, he would go on
again.</p>

<p>He wore only a loin cloth, hence his body was
free from any covering which would keep the
pores from working and performing their duty—the
second secret of his endurance.</p>

<p>Now, if this man had been dressed in underwear
and over this skin covering wore a pair
of trousers and a jacket, he would have become
tired, had a heavy feeling throughout his limbs,
and if forced onward, succumbed to headache—that
is he would have shown all the symptoms
of self-poisoning. Especially so would this
have happened had the baths been denied him.</p>

<p>Similar habits and customs were the reason
for the Indian being able to run long distances
and keep the pace up day after day.</p>

<p>But you ask; how about the Northmen;
the Icelanders, those hardy and enduring men
of Lapland? Surely they have to wear heavy
clothing and have no hot baths along the roadside.
Partly true; but their endurance is of a
different nature; it is that of being able to
put out great muscular power, to withstand
severe cold and long fasting. This latter ability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is simply because when they <em>do</em> eat it is a gorging
of fatty food; food which gives out heat.
The Eskimo remains quiet and semi-asleep
many months in the year. When he makes a
kill for food he and his family—even the
babies—eat like wolves. They stuff themselves
like the animals, then go to sleep in
the winter and live off the fat on their body.
Then their form of endurance is one of race—a
trait which has been passed down to them
for generation after generation. But I am
doubtful if their contact with civilization does
not injure this trait, and then will come their
extinction.</p>

<p>But contrary to the general impression those
hardy Northmen living in Norway, Lapland
and Iceland take excellent care of their skin.
In traveling in Iceland after a hard day’s
work over ice fields and lava deserts, the natives
would bring us to camp where there were
either hot springs or little huts built of lava
blocks which were primitive Turkish baths. In
these huts were round stones; upon these they
would build a hot fire and after it had burnt
to ashes these were brushed off and water
poured upon the stones. This produced a hot
steam in which the natives would remain until
the sweat poured down in streams. Then after
rubbing each other they would put on their
heavy homespun clothes and emerge fit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
another day’s hard work. It is the same in
Norway and Lapland.</p>

<p>These habits are what gives them the ability
to endure physical work without exhaustion.</p>

<p>While upon this subject I would like to
impress upon you the unnecessary custom of
using any perfumes upon the body. The
sweetest odor is that coming from a clean,
healthy skin.</p>

<p>There is another feature of this skin cleanliness—the
help it gives the kidneys. A lot of
poisonous matter is cast off from the kidneys.
Now, if the pores of the skin are kept constantly
open, much of this material goes out
through them, thereby relieving the kidneys
from extra work. As you grow along in years
this becomes a very important matter, for many
kidney diseases are due to the overwork they
have had to do, when it could have been better
done by the skin. When we come to dealing
with vital matters in keeping good health—the
care of the sex organs—more will be told
you about these poisons.</p>

<p>As considerably more than ninety per cent.
of the body is made up of water, you can
realize how necessary it is that plenty of pure
water should be supplied the body. Here
again the sweating process aids man to replace
waste water by returning to it pure water.
The loss of water containing poisonous stuff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
makes one thirsty, and this is one way Nature
has of keeping man’s body well balanced—the
useless goes out and the useful goes in.</p>

<p>If we thoroughly understand what our body
consists of and how to care for it, there would
be no necessity for doctors or medicines. In
fact, drugs are far more harmful than useful.
Four or five simple medicines—or rather correctives—are
all man needs if he has the proper
understanding of himself. Of course surgeons
are necessary and doctors in accidents—such
as the great diseases like pneumonia or typhoid,
for these are really accidents, accidental insomuch
as you have taken poisonous germs into
your stomach or lungs. But even in this latter
disease, knowledge of how it is contracted is all
that is necessary, for then we can keep our
sewerage from emptying into the drinking
water; flies from landing on refuse and then on
the food we are to eat, and if you carefully
remember all I shall tell you, those diseases
which are breaking down so many of our
fathers and mothers, can be avoided. Kidney
troubles, as I informed you, may be avoided
by commencing to see that the kidneys do not
do the work that the skin is intended to do.</p>

<p>And the liver? Just remember what I said
about it being the “clearing house” of the
body.</p>

<p>There are many boys and young men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
have a sluggish or over-active liver. These
unfortunate chaps have always been misunderstood
and often blamed for being slothful or
willful, when in reality they were suffering
from poisons in their body which were not
cast off. If these conditions go on, the result
is sometimes very unfortunate—destructive to
any attempt to make a success in life—no
matter how hard one tries.</p>

<p>Here is a case that came under my observation,
only one of many; oh, so many misunderstood
fellows.</p>

<p>He was twenty-seven years old when I saw
him. His father and mother were heart-broken
over his habits—that is what they called
them.</p>

<p>Everything they knew had been tried; but
he <em>would</em> drink at times. These sprees came
over him at certain times and nothing the doctors,
ministers or friends could do would stop
him.</p>

<p>We know better now.</p>

<p>When he was a boy at school he would have
severe headaches. When they first came on
he would try to keep up with his studies, but
day after day became more indolent and the
teachers called his attitude “pure cussedness.”
At the end of the attacks he would become very
sick; vomit for hours, and when the poison was
thrown off through his stomach he was weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
for days after. The doctors who were called
all said about the same thing: “Only a bilious
attack; he will be all right after he has thrown
the bile off.” But he never was all right.
Each attack left some residue of the poison;
also left him less able to fight against another
attack, and so the poor chap went on suffering
misery of the body and pain of soul because
he was blamed for a state over which he had
no control. He became useless to himself, and
after he had reached full age could find nothing
to do because he could not stick to anything.
One day when he was feeling so badly that he
could hardly hold up his head, some older man
suggested a drink of whisky. He took it; it
was the first and only thing which had given
him relief. Of course this “relief” was only
a blind one; the alcohol gave him a false impression
of his condition. It also sent the
poison running through his brain and this
called for more whisky. When the next attack
came on he, of course, took whisky again and
remained practically insane until the whisky
drove the poison out through his stomach
AND SKIN—it sweated it out.</p>

<p>But by this time he had been pronounced a
drunkard. He was nothing of the kind; he
would have given up his life for a cure of the
awful demand for whisky when these attacks
came over him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>These cases we call dipsomania; and they are
now understood to be cases of faulty work on
the part of the liver and other organs which
retain the poisons of the body.</p>

<p>Turkish baths, sweating and other methods
soon put him in a position to understand
himself. He was shown just what to do to
keep the poisons out of his body and hence
keep off the attacks. Of course his liver had
been injured, and probably his kidneys, by the
absorption of so much alcohol; but by care and
watchfulness he became a useful citizen, but
could never for a moment forget his delicate
condition.</p>

<p>Now it is not necessary for you to understand
what to do in these cases—but it is
necessary for you to understand how to keep
from getting into the same state.</p>

<p>If you have headaches due to some cause
that you do not recognize—as you would from
those following blows or breathing foul air in
closed rooms—just remember that some organ
of the body—skin, kidneys or liver—is retaining
poison. You must get rid of that at once; for
every hour it remains it accumulates and if
allowed to go on, some of the organs will be
affected. Then when you get to be forty and
over you will wonder why your kidneys are
not in perfect health or why you have become
so nervous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>If the headaches are so distressing that you
cannot exercise violently enough to sweat—not
simply perspire—then get out in the air,
no matter what the weather is, and take long,
deep breathing exercises. Keep this up until
your chest muscles ache. Now you should
commence to feel better. Put all the pure
water in you you can hold. After a while
make a brave effort to exercise so that the
water and its poisons run off your skin. Then
wrap yourself in a thick blanket and go to bed.
Before breakfast eat some fruit and drink
plenty of water. After your bowels have
moved you should be feeling as fit as a trivet.</p>

<p>If this feeling of well-being possesses you,
then it is certain you had an overplus of the
natural poisons in your body.</p>

<p>If this advice and knowledge had been the
possession of boys and youths twenty years
ago we should not have to build hospitals for
dipsomaniacs as we are doing to-day.</p>

<p>All I am saying to you and shall say, does
not mean you should not consult a doctor—quite
the contrary. What I want you all to
understand is some of the important matters
that have not been told boys by teachers or
parents—things which, when you thoroughly
grasp, will make your growing life free from
worry and misunderstanding. Oh! there are
so many moments in a boy’s life when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
needs to know things; when he longs for that
knowledge; when he suffers inwardly, is afraid
of himself and when he only gets from his
father or mother the advice: “You had better
go and see the doctor.” And the doctor? Generally
gives him a slip of paper and tells him
to return in a day or so to see if the medicine
works.</p>

<p>And the soul-suffering chap needed something
more than a slip of paper.</p>

<p>He needs someone to help him unburden
his mind; to free him from his worry, to confidentially
overhaul his mind and put him to
rights again. Some man who was and is a
boy, and who can say to him: “Here is the
trouble, Harry; it amounts to nothing now; so
glad you came to me; for we can show you
how to rid yourself of the worry. Now be
sure to come again when anything worries you;
or you want to know.”</p>

<p>Go to your old doctor and talk to him about
what worries you. Most doctors will be pleased
to chat with you. The trouble is that you have
not been instructed in the fact that what you
want from a man of knowledge and kind and
appreciative heart, is a good talk, not medicines.
Go and have a plain talk with your
father first; if he is too busy to give you the
time then seek a friend in the physician—the
right kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Boys, if you are healthy boys, no matter if
you haven’t big muscles and strength, all you
need for a tonic is fresh air, plenty of sleep and
food, and a clear understanding of your body.
Not one single portion of it or its uses should
be kept from your knowledge, and it shall not
in these chats.</p>

<p>Boys often ask me: “Doctor Howard, what
shall I eat to make me big and strong? Is
underdone meat good? Shall I chew, so many
times, all my food?” and many other questions
along the same lines.</p>

<p>Eat what you like. In this matter study
the healthy animals—for in our bodily living
we are simply animals. Let all food fads alone.
The only rule to follow is that of common
sense. You should be certain that the food
is fresh, that you eat at regular intervals and
only eat that which you relish. Man, as an
animal, needs variety. Sometimes a boy will
crave one kind of food, at another time a
totally different sort. If he is not suffering
from some disease, nature tells him what chemical
constituents his body needs and then gives
him a craving for the foods containing these
materials.</p>

<p>I know of some fathers who wrongly blame
a boy because he will not eat fat with his
meat. The father likes fat and so unthinkingly,
believes that the son should not waste it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
relish it. The full grown and the elderly man
needs fat to give him heat; the boy has hot
blood coursing in him and besides, exercises;
his system does not need fat; so his appetite
rebels. If he relishes fatty substances, it shows
that his system needs it.</p>

<p>And so on through all foods—eat what you
relish if it is fresh. Of course there are
a few general principles to be followed. Chewing,
for instance. Every animal chews his
food according to the nature of its food. Man
has teeth to handle all sorts—flesh and vegetable.
Watch a good-sized dog eat—not the
lap dog brought up on candy and cookies; such
is not a regular dog; just an unfortunate,
wheezy, overfat, ill-smelling substitute for a
little baby—something to fondle. The boy’s
dog will bite, grind and then chew his bone
or meat. He does not count the number of
times his jaws work, just gets the food ground
up into small pieces so that the digestive fluids
in the stomach can get it ready for further
digestion in the intestines. For in reality it is
these latter organs which have more to do with
digestion than the stomach.</p>

<p>This brings us to a very important subject—the
care of the teeth. There is only one thing
to say about the teeth—ALWAYS KEEP
THEM CLEAN. I know boys are naturally
careless in this matter—we all are; but if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
commence the habit of always cleaning them
after each meal—or whenever they have had
work to do, you will be saved much future
misery and chagrin. Foul teeth always means
foul breath. Decayed teeth means that your
muscles can never reach their full development
because the food cannot be properly chewed
and churned; hence the blood and muscles do
not get the benefit of the nourishing elements
of the food.</p>

<p>You should not delay nor try to attend to
your teeth aside from keeping them clean.
At the least sign of decay or the appearance
of color on them, go to a dentist. There is no
pain or distress in the dentist’s chair if you
attend to the matter at once.</p>

<p>Drink plenty of water before breakfast, then
when possible, fruit. Remember that there
are about thirty-three feet or more of piping in
your body. Through this piping—the intestines—there
is a constant flow of food-stuff
undergoing a chemical process. It leaves a
lot of dirt—useless stuff—in the pipes. Now
if you had a series of lead pipes through which
flowed constantly some fluid which made a
deposit on the sides, you would naturally
flush out the pipes, every once in a while—wouldn’t
you? Of course you would.</p>

<p>Well, do the same with your system of
piping. In the morning there is a lot of useless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
matter containing germs left in your thirty-three
feet of intestines. Flush them out by
large drinks of water, plenty of it. This will
also keep your bowels free; the principal thing
to observe if you wish a healthy body.</p>

<p>Shall I drink water with my meals or after—or
when?</p>

<p>Again watch your dog; he drinks when he is
thirsty; do the same. It is better to drink
some water just before meals, and if your meal
has been somewhat a dry meal, drink water
during that meal; if you desire it—just do as
your system demands.</p>

<p>Do not attempt any training through a
regular system of diet. If you prefer a lot of
meat and like it, it is going to do you good; if
you force underdone meat down against your
liking, it is going to weaken your muscles instead
of strengthening them.</p>

<p>Is candy or other sweets harmful?</p>

<p>No; not a bit—the normal boy often needs
sugar—his system demands it. But here is the
trouble with all sweets—they are too often
eaten between or just before meals. This
destroys the edge of a good appetite and hence
the habit is injurious—not the candy itself.
After meals if you crave sweets they will do
you good. Chocolate is beneficial to all boys
if eaten only after the second or third meal of
the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>But there is so much adulteration of all
candies and chocolate that in order not to injure
yourself you should avoid all cheap stuff,
and especially that rotten mess sold on the
street stands. Then think of the dirt and
germs which have accumulated upon these
adulterated sweets. Get the best or leave
sweets alone.</p>

<p>Now one little word about training for the
boy and the youth. Never train to get off
weight but to put it on. Remember that every
tiny cell in your body is growing and developing
to be of use when the great time in your
life’s struggle comes. Anything you do to
stop this growth injures your future prospects.
The stoppage of one minute’s growth of a cell
can never be regained. That little improvement
that was about to be made has been
interrupted—stopped. Aid Nature in her
growth and development—don’t interrupt her.
If you do, later on in life she will punish you—this
is as certain as is the rise of the sun.</p>

<p>If you have done some sprinting in the
spring, and when you return to school find that
you are a little too heavy for running, don’t
for a moment think of trying to reduce your
weight.</p>

<p>Just quit sprinting and be very thankful that
you are in such excellent health that every
organ in your body is growing big and strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Any exercise that puts on weight in the boy
or youth is good exercise—anything that takes
off weight is harmful. When you have reached
middle life, if you are in good health and
busily occupied in doing your allotted work
in this world—as every healthy—mentally and
morally—man has to do, you will have enough
to do to keep off the extra and unhealthy fat
that has accumulated around your organs.</p>

<p>I know of a very sad case of this trying to
insult nature in a growing boy. He was
sixteen years of age; big, strong, and a champion
wrestler in his class. He was entered to
wrestle for the interstate championship—140-lb.
class. His instructor and the athletic club to
which he belonged expected him to win for
them. But as the weeks went on he gained
weight at a very rapid rate. He was a
straight, wholesome, moral boy—of course he
gained weight—he lived right. Two days before
the contest he was seven pounds overweight.
His trainers took measures to bring
him down—to rob Nature of that seven pounds
of her good work. They did it; he lost the
match and from that time onward he has never
regained his full strength. The process of
building going on smoothly in all his organs
was interfered with, and the inevitable setback
followed.</p>

<p>Every boy—every person—should sleep alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Think of what I have said about the skin and
its emanations. You do not want to be under
the sheets with another boy who is throwing
off from his skin poisons; breathing some of
them, letting others be absorbed by your own
pores. Try to get two dogs to sleep under the
same blanket—respectable dogs, such as you or
I would own. In about two minutes each will
get from under cover with distended nostrils
and deep breathing. They’ll sleep together
without covering; but never under it.</p>

<p>Sleep alone under as light coverings as possible
for comfort. This will aid you in getting
big and strong. Don’t forget this advice.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>HOW ALL LIFE COMMENCES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>We have seen that the human body after
it gets started is quite as much a physical apparatus
as a chemical laboratory, and the
harmonious working of all its parts is to a
considerable extent a matter of mechanics.</p>

<p>You will find that this is true for every
disease or disturbance of the body. For instance;
nervousness or headache from eyestrain.
This strain may come through insufficient light
or light wrongly entering the pupil of the eye.
The nervousness may come because there is
too much effort to adjust the lenses of the eyes
by a constant pull on the tiny muscles. Even
that peculiar nervousness that many unwise
men and women are suffering from which makes
them take ruinous drugs, is due to a chemical
disturbance of the nerve cells. All the drugs
in the world will not help them—it only increases
the chemical disturbance. These sufferers
need the poison out of their system;
not more put in.</p>

<p>And so it goes on throughout the whole system;
some of the physical or chemical elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
are unevenly balanced or worn out for the
time. In diseases due to a particular germ—like
diphtheria or pneumonia—it is the disturbance
of the chemical elements in the body which
brings about the disease.</p>

<p>But we have finished with the chemistry and
machinery of the body and now enter upon
the wonderful and interesting part of life
which deals with reproduction—the continuance
of species. Every living thing—flowers, fishes,
animals, man—is reproduced by laws all having
the same principles. The underlying facts
in all these different forms of life are the
same. There is absolutely no exception to the
law of reproduction. Every living thing is
the result of the mating of the male element
with that of the female.</p>

<p>We shall not have much to say about botany
or zoology, you can read all about these sciences
in your books. What I shall tell you in the
rest of our chats are things which you do not
get from your books or teachers.</p>

<p>It makes no difference what your religion is;
what you have been taught to believe, how
little or how much you already know about the
laws of nature, you will all have to come to one
conclusion as you get along in the world—that
God, Nature, or some great Power controls
and rules everything on this earth. You cannot
avoid this conclusion after knowing certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
facts—positive facts which are to be seen everywhere
in all their glory.</p>

<p>As you grow older and reach full manhood
many of you will become scoffers at all religion;
some of you will call yourselves atheists, others
agnostics—one who does not know—more of
you will have a blind faith in orthodox religion.</p>

<p>But if you have kept your brain power and
moral health, and I shall show you how to do
this, in the end you will all come to the right
point—reverence and love for the great Power
which controls us all.</p>

<p>You cannot avoid this desired point in life;
it WILL come in time. Worry and impatience
in your youthful days; self-questioning and a
feeling that something is wrong with the world,
will be your portion of man’s burden. You
will see what looks like injustice, the apparent
success of the evil-minded, the accumulation of
wealth by the man of shady methods, and those
who should be happy, miserable, and those
who in your estimation should receive punishment,
living in luxury, and highly esteemed.</p>

<p>But this vision will lose its distortion as you
live on; you will then see matters in their true
light. Have you ever looked down through
clear water and seen rocks, even fishes, appearing
queer and out of shape? When you dive
down to the bottom and open your eyes, how
different the true outlines of these things look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to you. You first saw them through distorted
rays; a false vision. It is just so with the truths
of life: you have to dive down into your heart
and mind to see their real shape and meaning.</p>

<p>I believe that every man is better for going
through all the phases of doubt, irreligion, and
becoming worldly wise; for when he does reach
the point of seeing right he thinks right. This
state causes him to be a true man to himself and
to the Power which controls him.</p>

<p>Get all sides of a question and then think
for yourself. And don’t forget that every
question has FOUR sides: the right, wrong,
inside and outside. When you have decided,
be true to your convictions and at the same
time keep looking around and INTO yourself.</p>

<p>We can all see the marvels of nature around
us, but we can never understand until we also
see the things IN us.</p>

<p>Deep within ourselves lie our powers. Getting
them out is what brings success. These
are the forces which every young man must
study for himself. There are no rules we know
that can be laid down for the governing or
control of that thing we call conscience, soul,
or whatever you care to call it. It is the vital
principle—it is the power within us to DO.
It varies in all men, its force, direction and
application directed rightly will bring man up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to marvelous deeds. No matter what your impulses
are, if they are for good living and helping
along the progress of man, go at them and
win out. If they make for evil, or the working
of injurious suggestion; go at them also, but
to give them the count. Put them down and
out. The first victory will be a hard one; but
as the pugilist gains confidence after winning
his first fight, and then goes on easily winning,
so you all can in this matter of fighting wrong
impulses.</p>

<p>Yes; it is this vital principle in us to Do,
that makes life worth fighting—that is, knocking
out the bad. It is also from this wonderful
source that comes the vital force in the seed of
males and the eggs of females, which, when
united, brings forth life—flowers or man. It
is with the laws governing this uniting of the
two sexes we shall now, in easily understood
explanations and words, chat about.</p>

<p>If I explain to you that the yellow or grey
dust coming from flowers is the male seed,
and that by wind, insects or birds it is deposited
in the female flower’s womb to grow
into little flowers, you certainly do not see anything
to laugh at; nothing wrong to talk
about, nothing in the wonderful arrangement of
nature to sniggle over or to go behind the house
or barn and whisper to other boys. Certainly
not. Neither will you, when you understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
all those marvelous laws which enabled your
good mother to give YOU life.</p>

<p>I want you all to take a hammer-lock upon
this fact—the holiest, most wonderful and everlasting
laws of nature will bring you to a state
of reverence and pure thoughts when you see
them from the inside; as you shall, as every
boy and girl ought to see them.</p>

<p>It is your birthright to know yourself and
the living brothers and sisters around you; to
realize that a mother dog with her little puppies
has gone through dog troubles and pain to be
able to give birth to her babies and to nurse
them just as your mother did for you. That
you owe to the mother dog the same kind
words you always owe your mother and sister
will be plain to you.</p>

<p>Everything during the course of reproduction—and
this is the only way the world is kept
alive—suffers pain, trouble, but in the end
gains happiness. We are bound, if we are
true boys and men, to remember this fact and
act accordingly. You can no more bruise a
flower in the spring without killing some little
life than you can kick a mother dog without
running the risk of killing her unborn puppies.</p>

<p>Both of these mothers, flower and dog, are
going to bring forth new lives from the same
great cause; the union of the male seed and
the female’s eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>All life comes from an egg. This is the first
law of nature. Every form of female has a
method of protecting her eggs so as to bring
them ready to receive the life germs of the
male. Some flowers bury their ovaries—the
organ that makes the eggs—in the ground.
Some form of water flowers show us how
careful we boys and men should be to protect
our powers from being wasted. These flowers
protect and keep their seed by closing their
sacks—corollas—under the water until the time
comes for them to act as fathers. If they kept
their seed sacks above the water the wind
would carry it away and then they would
have none to place in the female flower when
she was ready to receive it; or the egg, which
is the same thing. Then this female flower
would be childless, and soon we should be
without the beautiful flowers.</p>

<p>It is on account of this care of the life-giving
germ that all nature, including intelligent and
strong men, is able to keep the world populated
and growing better. For in spite of apparent
signs of the non-improvement of the men and
women to-day, in reality we are getting to be
better men and women. And a plain understanding
of life such as I am chatting to you
about, is one of the good signs; for in your
mother’s and father’s days these important
matters were left for them to pick up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hazard and often from the wrong sources.
But it will not be so with you; knowing the
truth you will all be able to live right, go to
your little wife a healthy man, strong in body,
clean morals and conscience and not suffer the
horrible self-accusation later on in life when
seeing your son or daughter a cripple, helpless
or incompetent. No, I believe that many of
these awful conditions will cease to be; for
they can be entirely wiped out if you heed and
act upon what I tell you.</p>

<p>Boys and young men have not had the seriousness
of this matter fully explained, and
through their ignorance have wasted life-energy,
ruined themselves and finally become
broken down in morals and bodily health, been
sent to insane asylums, or died in hospitals
from diseases caught through evil habits.</p>

<p>Ignorance has caused them to be fathers of
weak boys, sometimes idiots, and of daughters
who followed the unmoral life of their father.</p>

<p>Now it may sound funny to you, but the
truth is, that if the boys in the past had really
known as much as the chipmunks, we should
have very few asylums for the insane or hospitals
for the horrible diseases. To be sure,
the chipmunk’s habits of right living so as to
have only healthy and sane children, is due to
instinct; but we have the same instinct; let us
see that it is not suppressed by ignorance on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the one hand and the upheaval of evil thoughts
and acts on the other.</p>

<p>Of course there are many diseases which are
not due to wasting of life’s energy or vicious
habits, but more than one-half of the degeneracy
and insanity in our land <em>is</em> due to these awful
mistakes.</p>

<p>We do not have crazy foxes or idiotic colts;
we seldom have any wild animal born unfit to
live. Yet the method of reproduction, the
mating of the male with the female, is just the
same as with man. The great difference is that
animals mate when in PERFECT condition.
Neither the lion, eagle, nor the rose, has wasted
or poisoned the vital fluid or dust by bad
habits, or lost their power by ruinous indulgence.</p>

<p>All these facts are a wonderful and plain
lesson to us; and when we think it over carefully
and recognize all it means, the question
rises: why have we done as we have been doing
all these long years of supposed intelligence?
Because your parents and grandparents were
not allowed to know the truth.</p>

<p>The pollen-dust of flowers is, as I have
said, the seed of the male flower, just as full
of life-giving energy as is the seed being produced
in you—and which you must protect
and save for future power and reproduction.
That is, when married to be able to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
father of strong, healthy children. The Bible
distinctly calls your attention to this matter,
and lays down the law.</p>

<p>Life is a long foot race; a constant struggle
to reach the tape. Now if you knew that you
had this race to run and to win, would you be
so foolish as to dissipate your strength, to lose
sleep, to run long distances until you were
completely exhausted just before you were to
start on the REAL race? Of course not; yet
when a young man exhausts his energies and
powers by wrong living and when tired out
enters upon his LIFE’S race—marriage and
fatherhood—he comes to the tape wasted, exhausted
and way behind the man who has
trained properly. As a rule he will not finish
the race—just be one of those “also ran.”
He will leave weaklings on the path, poor
unfortunate children who suffer all their lives
because their father was UNFIT—unfit to be
a father at any time. I realize these are harsh
and strong words, but they tell you the truth,
and I warned you that you would hear the
truth.</p>

<p>I believe with a very strong belief that you
boys to-day will be in a position to give the
world better men and women than the world
has ever known. You are being shown how
to make yourselves fit to bring this about.</p>

<p>Every day I hear the cry: “Oh! Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Howard, if I only had known these things
when I was a youth! What a different man I
would be to-day!” I have had men tell me
that they would willingly have cut an arm off
for such knowledge as you boys are getting,
and considered the fee cheap at that.</p>

<p>We will now leave the flowers and their
forms of reproduction and get right into things
that every boy sees, yet had not had a thorough
understanding of what relations they bear to
his life and those dear to him.</p>

<p>To repeat: <em>All</em> life comes from an egg.
You know how the eggs of fishes look as well
as the fact that the shad roe you eat is a mass
of eggs. The male shad is called the buck
shad or the milt shad. The milt is the semen of
the male shad. It is a milky-white substance.
The little life-giving germs are hidden in this
milk-like fluid. They are so small that it takes
a powerful microscope to see them.</p>

<p>The eggs of the female cannot produce life
unless the life germs of the male pass into them.
This is true of all animals, including man.
Every form of living thing has a different
method of doing this, but the principle is the
same for all. Let us first take the fishes.</p>

<p>Springtime is the season for all life to bring
forth its kind. In the spring the fishes swim
to their spawning or breeding places. They
seek warm and generally still waters. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
shad, for instance, swims up rivers until it finds
the proper place. By this time the eggs are
ready to be expelled from her ovaries, the
sacks in which they have been forming all
winter. As she lies still in the warm waters
these eggs drop out in large quantities. Then
she swims away, gradually making her trip
down to the sea. At the same time that her
eggs are ready to be deposited in the waters
the male shad is filled with milt-fish semen.
He is strong, vigorous, and never having
wasted any of this seed he is able to give
full life to the waiting eggs. He slowly
swims over the floating eggs and the semen in
him pours out. Once over the eggs each little
life-germ wiggles through the outer lining of
an egg and meets the true egg. At once these
two, the female and male germ, are the beginning
of a little fish. It takes some time, of
course, for even the little fish to burst from
its covering, for the growth from the two germ
cells into a completely-formed, though tiny fish,
occupies many days. But just as soon as it is
ready to swim, out it comes.</p>

<p>The way the different kinds of fish protect
their young until they can care for themselves,
is an interesting study, but you can read all
about such matters in your zoologies.</p>

<p>In breeding, or propagating, fish at the
hatcheries, the eggs are squeezed out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
female and immediately after this has been
done the milt from the male is squeezed out
over them. This is never done except when
both female and male fish are ready to deposit
their eggs and sperm. By this method the
little fish can be kept in confined waters,
arranged according to their ages, and when old
enough, be sent to replace fished-out streams.</p>

<p>It is wonderful that with all the hundreds
of different kinds of fishes in the ocean and
rivers, the seed of the male will enter only
the eggs of its own kind. It is the same
throughout all life on the world; like can only
reproduce like. If it were not so, we should
have a sorry mess of mixtures and all life
would die out.</p>

<p>When we leave the fishes and come to the
higher scales of life, we see the same method
of development from the union of the female
and male elements—the egg vitalized by the
male seed. But there is a difference in the
methods of protecting the growing life in the
egg. The fish simply drops her eggs and
leaves them for the warm water to hatch. The
birds deposit them in a ready-made nest and
keep them warm by their own bodies.</p>

<p>The “frog spittle” you see on ponds and
along the banks of streams is the mass of eggs
and sperm from the male and female frogs.
The bullfrog does not, like the male fish, throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his life germs over the eggs of his mate after
she has deposited them in the water. This is
done before she lets them leave her body. The
frog’s method of vitalizing the eggs is that of
all the higher animals.</p>

<p>When the eggs in the female are ripe for
the male seed they lie inside her near their outlet.
The bullfrog introduces his seed directly
into her body at the spot where the eggs are
waiting to receive it. A short time after this
takes place the eggs are cast upon the waters
and left for the sun to develop the little pollywogs,
or tadpoles. When ready, those tiny
fellows with their funny tails swim out and
remain in large groups until their tails drop
off and hind legs have grown.</p>

<p>If you have ever tried to stir up a large
lot of “frog spittle” you have noticed how
difficult it is to break up. This is another
wonderful provision of Nature to protect her
living and growing things. The greenish mass
you see is a mucilage-like substance made to
hold the eggs together. The real eggs are
those tiny black spots. If it were not for this
sticky material, the wind and waves would
break up the whole mass and leave the eggs to
be washed away and chilled. In other words,
not one would send out a little pollywog, the
wiggling frog bodies would be chilled to death.
So remember that when you try to break up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
lot of frog spittle you are really killing thousands
of little pollywogs—frogs to be.</p>

<p>The same method of breeding takes place
among the turtles and snakes. Only here the
eggs are not cast off directly after receiving the
male seed. They stay in the female, as they
do in the birds and hens, until they have received
a protecting cover. These reptiles have
not reached the scale of the birds and hens;
they are between the frog and the bird. As
we have seen, the frog has the mucilage-like
substance holding together the eggs; the hens
and the birds the hard shell protecting each
egg; the turtle and his like have a soft
shell.</p>

<p>The turtle, alligator, and those of the same
kind of reptiles do not sit on their eggs. The
female makes a kind of a nest in the sand or
dry mud, lays the eggs, covers them over with
sand and leaves the sun to do the rest. There
are, however, many differences in the manner
of HATCHING, the way the eggs are protected,
and how the little ones are left to shift
for themselves. But the manner of <em>starting</em>
each different form of life is always the same.</p>

<p>In the bird, as in all live creatures of the
female sex, are what we call ovaries, from the
Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ovum</i>, meaning egg. These ovaries
are situated in the body in the region we call
the groin. These ovaries are little sacks which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
have the power of creating eggs. As breeding
time comes, these eggs drop out from the
ovaries and remain for a short time just outside
the sacks, but still in the bird’s body.</p>

<p>Now the birds commence to mate, which is
really nothing but the powerful instinct to reproduce
their kind. The male bird is ready
to be a father. He becomes vigorous, proud
and strutting. His plumage is shining brilliant
and he tries to show himself off before
the females, who soon pick out their mates. The
birds of the turkey or partridge type, dance,
fight and sing in order to attract the attention
of the females.</p>

<p>As soon as mating takes place, off the couples
go to build their nests, both working together
early and late to make a warm place for the
little ones to be hatched.</p>

<p>The mating has taken place, the eggs of
the female have become vitalized. The life
germs have worked their way into the interior
of the eggs; the eggs now commence to take
on a protective covering; the shell. This soon
grows to a hard shell. The eggs now being
safely protected they drop out into the nest,
and when all have been laid, the mother, and
at times, the father bird, sit upon them until
the little ones are hatched.</p>

<p>If the female bird was kept in a cage and
away from the male bird, the eggs would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
just the same. But no amount of sitting
upon them or putting them in an incubator
would bring forth the young. The reason you
all readily understand; the eggs have not been
vitalized, given the sperm, by the male bird.
So if you want to breed chickens you must
always have a cock in the yard.</p>

<p>All breeders of chickens first examine the
eggs they are to put under a hen or in an
incubator. By the light of a candle in a dark
room you can see a tiny spot in the egg if it
has been vitalized. This spot is the germinal
spot—the evidence of the male element. Such
an egg will hatch; one without such a spot will
simply rot.</p>

<p>When we reach the higher scale in animal
life, where the dog, horse, lion, belong, we have
reached that point where all reproduction takes
place in the same manner as in man. I am
referring now to details only, for as I have told
you, the PRINCIPLES of reproduction are
the same for everything that lives.</p>

<p>All through nature, if you carefully think
over the strict laws governing the continuation
of life, you will be struck with wonder and
reverence; not curiosity nor evil thoughts.</p>

<p>At first it may sound a little harsh to have
me tell you that you were developed from a
single cell in your mother’s womb which had
been vitalized by the seed of your father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
But such is the undeniable truth, and it is the
truth concerning ourselves that I want you to
understand.</p>

<p>Of course we are different from the mere
animals in having a something in us that they
do not apparently possess. This “something”
may be called a soul, the essence of a Great
Will, the evidence of God. But it makes no
matter what you have been taught to call it—it
is there; and some day you will recognize it.</p>

<p>It is the great Power back of us, in us,
ahead of us. It is the something we can feel,
but not see nor demonstrate. As you study
over what I tell you it will be plain that, while
we can and should understand the laws of
nature, this Power, the actual Power itself
must be studied in our hearts.</p>

<p>But no man has done justice to this great
Will, or to God, or to himself, who has avoided
trying to understand those laws which are
indubitably for our benefit and future progress.
One of the plain duties which the law points out
to us, is that of so regulating our lives that we
can give health and moral strength to those
who come after us. And this can never be done
unless we know and obey those laws which we
have plainly set before us.</p>

<p>Before going further into the facts of reproduction,
let us see how strict Nature is in
some of her laws controlling this process.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Remember what I said about the marvelous
fact that fishes do not inter-breed; that is, that
the seed from a male salmon will not enter the
eggs of a female bass, nor that of a “shiner”
into a sunfish. Nature will not allow such a
mixing of things. A dog cannot impregnate
a cat, only a dog. So you see that Nature has
so arranged matters that in spite of the running
wild of all kinds of animals and species, each
egg is so chemically adjusted that only the
male seed made for its particular eggs can
vitalize them.</p>

<p>“But,” you say, “I saw at the circus a half
tiger and a half lion, he rode a horse.”</p>

<p>True, but you have so long been accustomed
to think that the lion and tiger were different
species of animals that it did not enter your
minds that in reality they were the same. Both
belong to the cat tribe—felines. Circus men
call all these animals, lion, tiger, cougar, leopard,
etc., “big cats.”</p>

<p>In their natural state even these animals of
the same species will not inbreed; there is a
social class among them; and while man forced
the lion to mate with the tiger, it was a forced
marriage and presumably a disagreeable one.
We have too many lion and tiger marriages in
our own society.</p>

<p>From all this we should derive a lesson.</p>

<p>Nature will not, however, give in altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to man’s foolish acts; for even when we cross
the species we get a thing that cannot reproduce.
The strict laws here step in and say:
“So far shalt thou go, but no farther.”</p>

<p>The mule is an example of what I mean.
The mule is the result of breeding the ass to
a mare. It is hybrid; it cannot reproduce its
kind. So in order to have mules we must always
use an ass and mare. The mule cannot reproduce
its kind because it is a born eunuch.
That is, it has no seed to give life to eggs.</p>

<p>Now in some respects the mule is more useful
to man than the horse. Again we see that the
laws controlling our lives are often adjusted
to our desires when these desires are for our
benefit. So we can breed from a mare and
stallion ass; but cannot go any farther with
the species. It is about the same with the inbreeding
of zebras and horses, although this
has not yet been carried far enough to determine
what the outcome will be. But don’t forget
this fact: ass and horse, zebra and horse
are all the same species—equines.</p>

<p>You have seen how birds and hens lay their
eggs in a nest, and how, if they have received
the male germ, the eggs bring forth their
young. In the higher forms of animals—those
who nurse their young—exactly the same
PROCESS takes place but under different
details. In these higher animals, the dog, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
instance, we have the ovaries making the eggs
just as in the birds. At certain intervals in
the year these eggs slip from the ovaries into a
nest lying just down beneath the two ovaries—one
on each side of the female dog. This nest
we call the uterus—or, in ordinary terms, the
womb. When these eggs slide into their nest
they produce an inflammation of the parts; also
a peculiar odor. This is another wonderful
law of nature, for without these conditions life
would soon cease to exist. The inflammation
gives the female dog—bitch is the proper name—a
longing to be a mother. It is nothing
impure in her, nothing to be ashamed of, but
a condition to be proud of and to cause reverence
in those of pure minds. The odor is to
tell the male that now he must do his share in
keeping dogs on the earth.</p>

<p>So they mate.</p>

<p>When each little egg is vitalized by the
dog’s sperm, they remain in the womb—the
bitch’s nest—for nine weeks, growing day by
day until they are ready to come into the world.</p>

<p>Then did you ever see such a beautiful
sight as the watchful and happy mother?
Never, if you have all the real feelings of
the genuine boy. There must arise that
in you which we all feel but cannot explain.
Kind words come to you as you watch the
happy dog mother; gentle strokes as she cuddles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to warm her little babies. And yet there are
boys who have so little understood the beauty
and wonder of all this act of reproduction that
they sniggle and make sport of the desires of
the innocent want-to-be-mother dog.</p>

<p>Exactly the same details happen throughout
all the animal kingdom. The larger the animal,
the longer it takes for the little one to grow
and develop in the mother’s womb. This is the
only difference, except that in the larger animals
we find one or two babies the general
rule. You see these big babies require so much
milk that the mother could not supply enough
for many hungry mouths, so she gives birth to
only that number she can well nourish and
care for.</p>

<small>CARE OF SELF DURING PUBERTY</small></h2>

<p>As the anxious mother bird watches day
after day, while keeping her eggs warm, for
the sound of the little tapping from the inside
followed by the soft bill and wondering eyes of
her little ones, so did your mother anxiously
watch and pray for the coming of her helpless
baby.</p>

<p>In her warm nest, the womb, you lay from
the meeting of the two cells until your tiny
body was completely formed. This was a
period of nine months. Then you were born.</p>

<p>No boy or man can have a full appreciation
of all he owes a mother until this wonderful
work of nature is thoroughly implanted on
his memory, never to be effaced. While the
period of watching and waiting is only nine
months, to the mother it is a whole lifetime.
For to her it means ALL her life—sometimes
she gives her life for yours. Think what wondrous
love there must be for a woman to run
the risk with pleasure and happiness. Every
moment of these nine months the mother has
her mind upon one thing: the tiny life growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in her womb, nourished by her blood, given
oxygen through her breath, brought into the
world smiling and laughing because the mother
is laughing and smiling. And her one hope is
that you will be able to go through your life
smiling and laughing; that you will so live and
grow that both of you can show to the world
the most powerful searchlight known to man:
the light which shines from a pure face and
healthy mind. And such a light is far more
penetrating than you have ever realized. It
searches out truth, it reflects your mother’s face
even after she has gone; it makes others happy
and brings hope to many worried homes. And
it is your mother who lights this bright ray of
a pure mind; but it is your duty to keep the
flame and reflector ever active and shining.</p>

<p>Thousands of boys and men have brought
tears and dimmed the once bright eyes of
their mothers. They have not consciously
done so. It is against all nature for a boy to
deliberately inflict pain and grief upon his
mother. When he does, it is because he has
been ignorant of all his mother has gone
through for him. He has never been told in
plain talks just all his mother worried and
suffered while waiting for him to make his
appearance on this earth. He never fully
realized how she often dragged herself around
weighted with his little body; how her nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
were sleepless on his account; how she worked,
sacrificed and planned for him. He never
knew how careful she was about her food so
he might grow strong while in her womb; how
she forced herself to walk when every step
was an effort, how she tried to keep her mind
upon pleasant subjects and to read only such
books as might send pleasant and beneficial
impulses to his then unconscious mind.</p>

<p>When you have reached eight or ten years
of age you have never been told how careful
you should be to use kind words and be ever
on the watch to help your mother in little
things, because there is a little sister or brother
growing in your mother’s womb who will soon
be in the cradle. No, you have of course been
told to be always kind to her; to help her in
little matters; but JUST why you should now
be more careful than usual has been kept
from you. So if you have been cross and
disobedient at times; brought tears to your
mother, and who knows but unconscious tears
to the little unborn one, you are not wholly
to blame. You didn’t know, and nine times
out of ten, if you asked questions about how
babies come, you were put off with queer
answers or else told not to ask such questions.
The fault has been in a wrong idea of
instruction. Your mother was never allowed
to know when she was a child; your father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
picked up what knowledge he could from
older boys, which was generally wrong knowledge
gathered from another generation of boys,
and your teachers and those of your parents
were either criminally silent or themselves
ignorant.</p>

<p>From all this false attitude of teachers has
grown much of the misery and disease which
is with us to-day. It is my intention to have
this misery and disease abolished, and it can
be done by giving you the information your
parents and teachers did not possess until too
late. All information regarding right sex living
and care should be in the possession of the
boy and youth while they can utilize such information.
Of what use is it to you after the
harm has been done through ignorance? No
use; more—it does much harm when it comes
too late.</p>

<p>“Oh, Doctor; if I had only known. Can I
never be a well man again? Why didn’t my
teachers and parents tell me all this was
wrong?”</p>

<p>I am going to try to stop the cause for these
pitiable cries so that in your and future generations
they shall be no longer heard.</p>

<p>In the same manner you have been kept
from knowing the absolute necessity of attending
to the sex organs with the absence of any
ideas except those of cleanliness. It is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
reasonable for you to clean the teeth and leave
the wax to accumulate in the ears until deafness
follows, as it is to wash your hands and
neglect the penis.</p>

<p>Your sex organ needs attention at an early
age. If you have parents who understand
this matter, they have instructed you in the
details; but if you are like most boys, these
have been left to chance and possible wrong
treatment.</p>

<p>The gland of the penis secretes a cheesy
material. This is constantly being poured out
in small quantities and unless cleaned away
will at first become offensive to the nostrils,
then irritating and in some cases proceed to
an inflammation which will require the services
of a surgeon.</p>

<p>But to begin with the small boy. He should
pull back the foreskin every morning as he
washes, and with a soft cloth soaked in warm
water, remove all the accumulation. Do it
carefully; but don’t forget to do it, even if
you have to let the face go. The reason for
being so particular about this matter I shall
explain further on in these Chats.</p>

<p>If your foreskin is too long, or if it hangs
over so as to retain some drops of urine after
you have relieved the bladder, go first to your
father; and if you are so unfortunate as not
to have a father or mother to whom you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
go in these matters—and I know there are
many such—go to your doctor and explain to
him.</p>

<p>Many boys are far better off when circumcised.
This is a simple little operation—just
the snipping off the overhanging foreskin.
If your parents have been wise and instructed
in this necessary detail of the sex toilet, you
will have been circumcised when a baby. But
you cannot blame them if it has been neglected.
However, <em>your</em> boy will have a right to blame
you if he is allowed to be a victim of irritation
and inflammation of the penis when he is a
youth.</p>

<p>As you grow older this detail of the toilet
becomes more and more necessary, for at
puberty—fourteen to sixteen years of age—all
your glands become very active, and those
of the penis especially so.</p>

<p>I have told you in the first Chat about the
bad effects of allowing your bowels to retain
matter that should always be kept out of the
body. The absorption of the poisons from
this dead stuff left from food causes headaches,
laziness and in time affects the complexion.
It is a lot of natural filth left in the pocket
of the lower bowel which Nature intends
should be thrown out daily. There are muscles
in this bowel or pocket especially for
this purpose. If you neglect to work the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
muscles placed for this purpose, they soon
become weak, inactive and refuse to perform
their duty unless irritated by some drug, salts
or castor oil. In a healthy boy—one who has
taken any decent care of himself—these medicines
are never needed. If such methods to
make the muscles of the lower bowel work are
constantly used, the muscles lose their tone and
of course usefulness. Then in later life the
veins become full of black blood, swell and
often burst. These swollen veins are generally
called piles. You see how you can avoid these
disagreeable things, which are only plain signs
that the man or boy has kept in his lower bowel
filthy stuff. Just think for a moment; would
you allow filthy stuff to remain in your pocket?
Of course not; yet if this stuff were kept
there, it would not do you physical harm. It
would be a little disagreeable, I admit, but
not bring about the ill health it does when
kept in the pocket of the bowel.</p>

<p>Now, when you have the gland of the penis
inflamed from the gathering of the matter
behind it, you can readily see how it may be
aggravated by any other dead material in
the same region of the body. And this region
in the growing boy is very sensitive to all
disturbances. So here is another reason why
you should empty your bowels EVERY day.</p>

<p>You will ask: Why is this secretion coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
behind the gland of the penis harmful if it is
natural?</p>

<p>It is there to keep the gland and its covering
from growing together. If it were not
there the urine would irritate and inflame the
parts. Whenever we have inflammation we
have a tendency to growth. Under these
circumstances the covering of the penis would
adhere to the gland, and then would come
great trouble.</p>

<p>The secretion is a sort of oil for the sliding
parts. But this oil has to be renewed by
fresh oil—this is the reason for washing the
old, rancid oil and letting fresh oil take its
place. Again, if this rancid secretion is allowed
to remain it becomes absorbed and then you
have another poison in your system.</p>

<p>It is useless for a boy to try to become a
strong man unless his sex organs have the best
of care. I don’t mean that you should keep
your mind upon the subject; quite the contrary.
If you have kept them clean and attended
to the little matters I have mentioned, your
mind will not be upon the sex organs. If you
wash your teeth every day and have them
always in good condition, you do not think of
them. You chew your food thinking of the
coming ball game—not of your teeth. But if
you neglect them soon come pain and trouble;
then in spite of all the thinking of the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ball game, your mind WILL go to those awful
teeth.</p>

<p>Just so with your sex organs; a decent regard
for their care drives out all thoughts
but what are necessary and decent.</p>

<p>The neglect or abuse of the sex organs—this
latter subject we shall have a plain talk
about—affects all the other portions of the
body. It causes stupidity and soft muscles.
Sometimes big muscles will be seen in a youth
who has neglected the toilet of his organs.
But these muscles are fatty muscles. They
do not contain strong, blood-red fibres of true
muscles. Moreover, the FORCE behind these
muscles, the nerve cells, are themselves weakened
by the absorption of secretions and the
whole general effect of the unclean and often
abused parts.</p>

<p>Remember this fact: You cannot perform
big deeds when a man if you have neglected
the little ones belonging to the development
of your body. The foundation of every
big structure, brain or building, is the
essential part of the work. Unless this is
built upon solid ground and of solid material,
ruin comes when pressure is brought to
bear.</p>

<p>I have seen hundreds of men with powerful
brains and intellects unable to utilize them
because their foundations for withstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
pressure were weak. And it was ever the same
old cry: “No one ever told me, Doctor!”</p>

<p>At an early age you will be faced by a great
injury to all boys. It is the appearance in the
public schools of smutty pictures, lecherous
talk and nasty stories. Now all these go to
make for a weak foundation. If you have
grasped the full sense of sex life,—what it
means to your future, what it can do for a
glorious life or a miserable end,—you will shun
such nasty things as you would a boy with
the smallpox. I want you all to know everything
about sex life; but smut and filth are
not connected with this knowledge. They have
nothing to do with sex development. Nothing
more to do with a full appreciation of the
powers growing in you than the ulcers of a
foul disease have to do with the growth of
a healthful skin.</p>

<p>These nasty tales and pictures befoul a good
mind. In listening or looking you are simply
allowing your growing brain to wallow in a
pigsty of thought. Scientific books on sex
life, all the real knowledge you can obtain
covering the real meaning of life, are proper
reading. It is not necessary to roll in a
manure heap to understand the care and diseases
of cows. It is not necessary, but harmful,
to live in an atmosphere of vice and mental
filth to understand man and woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>So you can see that it is as important to
keep the mind clean as it is any organ. For
one affects the other. If you have an unclean
mind, poisons flowing through the brain from
filthy talk, you will find that the sex organs
will feel the effect. This is a dangerous state.
Clean both at once and keep them clean as they
grow.</p>

<p>Why, boys, there is scarcely one of your
waking dreams of big deeds that is not
possible of being true if you keep a mind
clean for big thoughts and work. But this
mind cannot work if it has to compete with
foul matter working alongside.</p>

<p>If you were engaged upon some delicate
work and had a chap working alongside of
you who pulled down as fast as you built up,
what would you do? Throw that fellow out.
Of course. Well, if he gets along inside of
your good thoughts, throw HIM out.</p>

<p>At this early age in your career I would
not advise you to attempt any missionary work
among those boys of evil thoughts and acts.
Just let them alone; have nothing to do with
them. This will appeal to such boys much
more than any attempt at “goody-goody” talk.
I don’t believe in this kind of education for
the boys of vicious habits; it doesn’t appeal to
them. What you can do if they ask questions
is to show them the PRACTICAL side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
whole matter: That you want to be a strong
man, a man who can do things, a man whose
children will bless instead of curse him.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to smash a boy
who makes evil suggestions to you. Don’t talk
to him, smash him in the face. Smash him good
and hard. Remember that if you have followed
my advice and directions you will have much
more strength than a boy of evil thoughts and
habits. Such a one will be a coward; even
if he LOOKS larger than you.</p>

<p>But beyond all, don’t blame such a boy;
don’t unjustly blame him for what he is. Perhaps
he had not had the chances you have
had. Possibly he has had no parents to care
for him and his associations have been such
that he cannot see the good in life. Remember
that such a boy has some good in him; often
he wants to be the right kind of a fellow but
does not know how. After you have licked him—if
he makes any really bad suggestions—then
he may become your good friend. If so,
then you can tell him what you know. But
no preaching, mind you. Don’t try to make
him think you are any better than he is. Just
let him understand that you know what is
necessary to make a strong and successful man.
Then he will want to know.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>NIGHT EMISSIONS AND THE BOY’S WORRY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As you reach the age of puberty and for a
few years thereafter, you will have many little
worries and hours of fear. There is absolutely
no reason why you should have these times of
self-fear or any kind of worry. The gradual
change from boyhood to manhood should go on
without mental worry or too much thinking of
the changes in yourself. Nature never intended
that this time should be any but a joyful and
happy time. And it can be made a period of
full content and feeling that all is right with
yourself and the good world.</p>

<p>But why have boys been so depressed during
this time of sexual growth and development?
Why is it that we see men whose whole
careers have been handicapped and physical
misery been their lot, just because when they
were youths they had some fright which has
lasted throughout life?</p>

<p>Because they were left the prey of their own
thoughts; because little matters that are natural
to the growing boy were exaggerated into fearful
diseases, because they struggled through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a fog of ignorance upon which were blown
the lies of older boys and the advertisements of
those beasts—the QUACKS.</p>

<p>To sum it all up in a few words: because the
boys were never told the real truth.</p>

<p>Truth is never vile, nasty nor injurious.
To hide the truth is criminal, cowardly and
injurious. But conditions which we will not
bother ourselves about here have kept our
parents and teachers from seeing the truth.
It is here where all the harm has been done to
the boy and the girl. You were not able to get
the truth because it was hidden from you, but
the lies, nasty lies, were allowed to get to your
ears and eyes. If there were any false colors
surrounding truth it certainly would not be the
TRUTH; would it? If the laws of nature
were untruthful in their significance, if nature
were all lies, then the whole world and the
power behind it is a LIVING LIE. But it is
not; it is a beautiful revelation of powerful
truths and when you know it as it is, nothing
more astounding or wonderful can possibly
fill your mind.</p>

<p>And to know the truth these things should
be plainly told you:—</p>

<p>About fourteen years of age you may feel
a gradual soreness in the nipples. This will
increase and sometimes be a little annoying.
Now don’t become frightened and try to recall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
some blow you have received there. It is only
a demonstration of how the growing sex instinct
affects all the body. There are little
glands in the breast that for a short time
become slightly inflamed and this produces the
soreness and itching which bother you.</p>

<p>I knew a boy who was much affected with
this soreness; he had no idea what it meant.
He worried about it silently and ceaselessly.
He could not apply his mind to his studies;
he lost sleep and ceased to play with his companions.
One day when he was moping
around the house his mother noticed how pale
and listless he was. She asked him what the
trouble was. He told her that his chest was
very sore; that the nipples pained him; that he
had suffered day after day.</p>

<p>Now what did this mother do? At once became
frightened so that she frightened him.
He at once thought that something horrible
was to happen to him. Poor boy! The mother
at once asked him if he had received a blow
on the breast? Of course he remembered such
a blow. Then this ignorant mother rushed to
her family medical book—the curse of many a
home—and commenced to read up on cancer of
the breast. Then she rushed off to the doctor,
leaving the book, which was at once seized upon
by the trembling and pale boy. Then he read
his doom—cancer of the breast; he had all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
symptoms! At once he lost what little heart he
had left, and when the mother returned she
made matters worse by her fear and sympathy.</p>

<p>The doctor? He wasn’t at his office; would
return the next day. That boy spent the night
in a fear which almost wrecked him. He could
not go to the doctor the next morning, he
was so weak from fear. When the doctor did
come, instead of laughing at the whole matter,
taking the boy aside and telling him what
the signs meant, he hemmed and looked wise.
Then he said he “thought it would pass away.”
But it did not, neither did the fear. The boy
just escaped complete ruin of his health, or
perhaps a worse fate at his own hands, by a
stroke of luck.</p>

<p>In the small city where he resided there
were a number of Chinese youths—sons of
gentlemen—being educated. One of them, a
chum of the unfortunate boy, called to see
what was the matter. Tearfully the boy told
him his pains and fear. The Chinese boy
laughed loud and heartily. Then HE told the
boy the truth.</p>

<p>You see these foreign boys had a real knowledge
of the truth given them before being sent
out into the world.</p>

<p>From that time onward this American boy
never told his mother anything about himself
or his thoughts; he had to get what knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
he wanted from other sources, and as his
Chinese friends soon went off to a large prep.
school, the later information came from older
boys who only knew the lies and untruths.</p>

<p>So never worry about these little pains or
uncomfortable feelings. They belong to your
natural growth and are signs that you are becoming
a man.</p>

<p>At about the same time hair will appear
on various parts of your body. It will make
its appearance there before it will be seen on
the face.</p>

<p>New and strange feelings will now be part of
your mental life. You will wonder about
everything around you. What is life? where
shall I go to when dead? what is religion? am
I fit to live? and all sorts of new and queer
ideas. Don’t bother about them; just go along
doing your best with the knowledge that all is
coming out right when you do your best.</p>

<p>Of course you cannot be perfect—you will
make many mistakes, do things which you
would be ashamed to repeat; often tell an untruth
when you wanted to be truthful. But this
does not make of you a sinful boy—just a
natural boy. Time and forthrightness in TRYING
to correct these errors will make you a
square man. That is what you must aim at
being—a square man—square with yourself,
God and man. A boy is a thing of many sides;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
he is in the rough; experience, growth and determination
cut away, hammer out and finally
polish the rough youth into a square man.</p>

<p>But he must have the proper tools for this
work and these tools are knowledge of self, determination
and forthrightness.</p>

<p>One natural act of the glands in the body
which now commence to secrete profusely, is to
empty themselves of an overload. Your testicles
are secreting life fluid. They do this constantly
and will keep on doing so throughout
a long life if you have cared for them as
they should be cared for; left alone until the
time has arrived for you to be a father.</p>

<p>Nights when the testicles are overloaded
with seminal fluid, they empty themselves.
But remember this fact: they only let out the
overflow, they never WASTE any. It is
something like that which goes on in a good
spring of pure water. This spring is always
welling up with fresh water; its overflow must
be taken care of, so off the excess water runs.
But you will notice that no more water runs
away than is necessary; the spring keeps up to
the same level and always has fresh water.
Dam it up and you all know what happens—a
muddy, dead mass of useless water. Go to
work and pump out the spring, and what
occurs? It is emptied, and if the pumping is
kept up will disappear altogether. It is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a useless, dirty and moldy hole where once
flowed pure, sparkling, live water.</p>

<p>Just so with the life spring in you. Let it
take care of itself. It knows how. But you
must protect it, as you would any good thing.
And this is done through the mind; by keeping
evil thoughts out of your mind the spring is
not emptied or muddied.</p>

<p>When the testicles are overflowing with their
fluid there comes a night for casting off this
overflow. Now this overflow irritates certain
nerves around the sex organ, these send a
message to the brain telling it to open the
glands and let out this overflow. This message
is the dream you have. It is nothing to
be ashamed of, nothing sinful or wrong, just
a sign that you are in good health and growing
to be a strong man.</p>

<p>Here is where the injury of evil thoughts,
smutty talk and reading comes in. If you
have been listening during the day to these injurious
things, when you sleep, some memory
of the things heard or seen remains on the
memory—as everything does. This brings
about injurious dreams, these dreams send a
message to your sex organs and they return an
order to open the valves of the testicles and
pour out precious life fluid. As you see, in
such a case it is not the overflow you are casting
off, but most valuable energy and muscle-giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
power. You have been drawing from
the well, and if you persist in this method you
will soon be a ruined boy. But the dreams
which come naturally do no injury to you
when they do not occur too often.</p>

<p>But how often should they come, Doctor?</p>

<p>Just wait for a few moments; we will soon
come to all those questions and their answers.</p>

<p>Let me first tell you, boys, that all the statements
of the Quacks, and of too many doctors
who are not known as Quacks but in heart
and method are worse than Quacks, are
abominable LIES. Every one of their advertisements
about “Lost Manhood” is a mean
falsehood. They are founded upon what is
natural for every boy to have occur to him,
but they confound in your minds the true
and the false. They try to scare you, and they
have scared millions of American youths and
boys, by telling you what happens is ALWAYS
a symptom of “Lost Manhood.” Nothing of
the kind, as I have shown you. If you will
all grasp and hold the facts I have and shall
tell you, we can drive these bloodhounds from
the land. When you realize that the advertisements
you read in some papers and those booklets
sent to boys are nothing but a pack of
lies gotten up to bleed you and frighten you,
the Quacks will fall away like leaves in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
autumn gale. We can raise such a wind, you
and I, that every Quack and his kind will have
to go digging sewers for a living—where they
belong.</p>

<p>“Lost Manhood” is such a rare condition in
the boy and youth that many doctors go
through a career of practice and never see a
case. Of course we have boys born with weak
brains, idiots, and those with a growth or disease
of the sexual center in the brain. This
makes them constantly handle their organs; they
are thinking of vile things only, they are really
insane on this one subject and of course soon
sink to the level of—no, not beasts—animals
are pure in their instincts—to the level of imbeciles.</p>

<p>I have shown you how you can bring yourselves
to the point of not being the fathers of
these unfortunate and horrid things.</p>

<p>The Quack takes all those natural occurrences
of boyhood and in his advertisements
points them out to you. He well knows that
each and every symptom he describes will be
found in all HEALTHY boys. For instance
he says that if you have dark rings under your
eyes it is a dangerous symptom. Of course
you will find dark rings under your eyes at
times. Just after a night’s natural emission.
This is the time to throw a scare into you.
You have never thought of those dark rings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
before, but now you look into the mirror, and
“Oh, I’m lost—there they are!”</p>

<p>Rotten nonsense! They have always been
there, but you didn’t receive the suggestion before
you read the advertisement or those criminal
booklets. And that picture: “Before
Taking; After Taking.” You know them well.</p>

<p>I was acquainted with a fellow who had
been quite an athlete. Somehow he never
seemed to make good. He tried almost everything
but never stuck to one thing. He passed
out of my mind for some time. One day I met
him on Broadway, swinging along full of health
and apparent contentment. He told me that
he had tried to be an actor, but was now doing
something better. He smiled and answered
that he was “making good money” when I
asked him what he was doing.</p>

<p>A few days after this little conversation he
came to my office. At least a forlorn creature
staggered in and sank down in a chair. He was
thin-looking, pale and had pimples all over his
face. His clothes hung on him—just hung,
nothing else. His arm was in a sling and
he talked with effort.</p>

<p>“You don’t know me, Doctor?” Then he
straightened himself up and showed a magnificent
figure even under the draggled clothes.
He was the athlete. Then he explained:</p>

<p>He had fallen downstairs in a photographer’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
shop and broken his arm, and without
waiting to wash and dress had rushed to
me. As he paid the fee out of a big roll of
bills he said:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy money, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“Beating you simple men out of your
rights. Why don’t you all wake up? These
fakers I am working for have gotten you
chaps beaten to a frazzle. Why, the phony
docs I work for just have a basket to shove
their suckers’ money in.</p>

<p>“What do I do? I am the ‘Great and
Only Before Taking and After Taking Artist.’
See? No?</p>

<p>“Well I learned the make-up on the stage.
I sit before the camera with my chest out, hair
curled, and in the best clothes this burg can
turn out. Then I am mugged as a fine specimen
of the doc’s work. This done, I go and
make up as you see me—next scene with slow
music: ‘The Lost Manhood’ act. Then the
photos are placed side by side and off they go
to the boys of this free and unwise land.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have several other stunts. I am
the original ‘Kidney Cure’ chap. Never
seen me, bent over, holding on to one rotten
kidney with an expression of Death on my
noble brow? I’m It in the next photo, fine
girls hanging onto my brawny arms or sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
happy with my two hundred pound, but happy,
wife while the fireside burns cheerfully. But
even the fire is a fake.</p>

<p>“I have a partner, too, in all these stunts;
she stands for a photo with all the latest on her
for the shapely woman, then they put a rig on
her and blow her up. ‘How to Reduce Flesh.
Why Be Fat When You Can, By Using Old
Doc’s Food, Look Like THIS?’</p>

<p>“Say, honest, Doc,—pardon, I forgot, Doctor,—how
long did it take you to learn your
professional duties? Look, the fakers I work
for can’t even write their own ads—it’s all done
for them by men who understand what’s wrong
with the boys and girls, schools and parents.
Wake up, Doctor, wake up and get some of
the Mazulum that’s flying around.”</p>

<p>I think, boys, that this story of a faker’s tool
will explain the whole matter to you better than
a talk in our own tongue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How often may a boy have these night
emissions without being injured by them?</p>

<p>Like all other physiologic functions the
answer depends upon the boy. That is, how
he works and plays; how well fed he is, and
how he lets off his steam. The boy in good
health and good surroundings, after he is sixteen
years of age, need not think about the
matter when they occur once a week. Should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
they be more frequent, occurring two or three
times a week for several weeks in succession,
then it means that something is wrong. But
nothing to worry about; just some little fault to
adjust. And the youth can do this adjustment
himself. He will understand himself better than
a physician can, after he has seen the truth of
these matters. Here is what I mean: Supposing
you have these “wet dreams” two or
three times a week and they keep up until
you commence to feel their weakening effect.
Now there is a cause for every effect. Find
the cause for their increase of frequency. Look
well into yourself. Have you been listening
to nasty stories? seen pictures which aroused
your baser instincts, or read books which you
know you should not have read? Yes, a little,
perhaps. Well, remember what I said about
the mind influencing the action of the sex
organs. You see that the remedy is in your
own hands. Just stop such pictures and
stories getting a place in your brain and the
emissions will also stop.</p>

<p>But above all things don’t get frightened,
don’t take any medicines or drugs, DON’T
BELIEVE A THING THE QUACKS
ADVERTISE. Be your own master in this
as in all matters.</p>

<p>There are other causes which you must correct.
The irritation I spoke about which comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
by letting matter remain in your lower bowel,
is sometimes a cause for too frequent emissions.
This material remaining so close to the
sex organs causes a pressure and heat. This
excites the parts and then goes the message to
the brain, bringing dreams and the letting out
of seminal fluid. Such a cause if continued
will do harm, but you can at once stop the
cause and then the emissions cease.</p>

<p>Too warm clothing will bring about the
same state by overheating the organs, hence
always sleep with as little clothing as is consistent
with comfort. In this matter you can
commence in the autumn to accustom yourself
to light coverings, so that when winter
comes you will not want a lot of heavy
blankets over you. And this is much better also
for the breathing process of the skin. Sleeping
on the back will, with some boys, always bring
on a night emission. Sleep on your side always.
If you are inclined to roll over in your
sleep and remain on your back, take a towel
and tie a knot in it. Tie this towel around
your back so that the knot comes in the middle
of the back. Then go to sleep on your side.
Should you roll over in the night, the knot
will wake you up. After a few nights of this
scheme you will break the habit of sleeping
on your back and so correct the habit of emissions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Cold-water bathing of the sex organs every
morning and night is an excellent way of
keeping up their tone and preventing a laxity
which has a tendency to bring on emissions.</p>

<p>If you hear a big, strong boy say that he
has an emission once a week and you have only
one a month, don’t worry about it. Nature
is taking care of you. It simply means that
the big boy secretes more seminal fluid than
you do. This by no means implies that he has
more manhood; it is just a difference in temperament—the
same difference as is shown by
a fair-haired boy and a black-haired boy. This
stands true only if both boys are living a correct
physical life.</p>

<p>I am not trying to preach to you, boys, but
I cannot let this subject go without warning
you about smoking. Now there is nothing
wrong or wicked about smoking—I smoke a lot
myself. But there are reasons why you should
not smoke before you have reached complete
development. Smoking does affect the growth
and vigor of the sex organs. It does so through
lowering the nervous system. Frequently I
have seen boys whose night emissions were
fast pulling them down, and the whole
cause of these losses was smoking. In strong
doses tobacco is a powerful depressant to the
sexual activity. It can be given in such doses
as to completely stop all seminal secretion. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
don’t forget this fact. I don’t think many
boys would smoke if they knew these facts, but
the trouble is that you have been told that
smoking was not nice, that it injured you, but
just HOW it injured you has not been told
in plain language.</p>

<p>Our next Chat will be on self-abuse, its
causes, how to stop the habit and what it means
if you do not stop it. We shall also have another
shot at the Quacks.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>SELF-ABUSE—HOW TO STOP IT—THE QUACKS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>This is a subject, boys, that has been much
distorted in its facts and quite frequently put
before you in a wrong light. To try and
frighten you, to prevent you from making mistakes
through ignorance, is not the way to
help a worrying boy. If he makes mistakes
and falls into injurious habits through lack of
knowledge of a certain subject, give him that
knowledge. But instead of placing knowledge
and truths before you, scarecrows and words
to make you fear have been hung for you to
see and hear. It is this fear that has been
put into you by those who have not fully explained
the whole matter, which the Quacks use
for extorting money from their victims.</p>

<p>Of course the HABIT of self-abuse means
ruin to both brain and body. It is degrading
to your true self, causes a loss of self-respect
and makes a coward of every boy and man.</p>

<p>How can it do otherwise? The mere loss
of the bubbling spring of manly life, the seminal
fluid, would bring about this cowardice in a
bravely born boy. Self-abuse is a cowardly way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to treat the growing man in you, and it throws
that cowardice right back in your face, makes
you a real, can’t-help-it coward. All this is
true of the HABIT. But this one fact I
want to impress upon you—don’t think because
you have succumbed to the desire a few
times, that you are lost, going to become insane,
or show upon your features the wrong acts of
youthful ignorance.</p>

<p>No, don’t worry yourself ill, don’t become
frightened at these misstatements, at what the
advertising doctors say in their lying circulars
and daily papers. All their statements are
lies and used to get your money and ruin your
health and happiness.</p>

<p>Little slips now and then before you have
reached full knowledge of what is right should
be forgotten, but the HABIT kept up will,
of course, bring you to uselessness and make
for failure in life.</p>

<p>Let us see how the practice is usually started.
I have told you all about the irritation which
arises from an unclean penis and a secondary
irritation from an unemptied bowel. Also
about too warm bed-clothing. In most boys
these irritations call attention to the organ.
Then there is an itching. This the boy seeks
to relieve by scratching or handling his penis.
All this sends blood to the organ. The blood
enters the spongy penis and causes an erection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Soon the boy finds a new and strange sensation
and finally performs the act.</p>

<p>What should he do when this strange sensation
comes over him? He should immediately
rise from the bed and pulling back the foreskin—if
he is not circumcised—plunge the
organ and surrounding parts into cold water.
But you see he has never been told, and so the
“first time” happens.</p>

<p>This is his first attempt at self-abuse. And
it is rightly called self-abuse, for it is an abuse
of a boy’s greatest power—manhood, muscle-force,
brain-health.</p>

<p>I know that some of your teachers and
parents will object to my telling you that a
few mistakes in boyhood will not ALWAYS
ruin you. All the fakers and Quacks will certainly
object, for the truth will drive them out
of business. But I intend giving you the
truth in these matters. It is the only way for
you to start right and know how to keep right.
I have no patience with those who would
build up a great scare for you when young to
have you find out later that it was only a
warning but not the real facts. I am going
to hit out from the shoulder in this matter;
no feints or ducking in going at the truth.</p>

<p>I have seen hundreds of men and youths
complete nervous wrecks from fear that the
few times they practiced self-abuse when boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
meant that they were doomed to go to the
asylum or death. And all this misery and
often a missing of good opportunities in life,
were due to the fact that they were told hobgoblin
stories which remained with them and
rose to frighten them at the most sensitive age
in life—early manhood.</p>

<p>No more of this wrong treatment should
be allowed. If these boys of the past generation
had been told how to care for their sex
organs, as you have, more than one-half would
never have succumbed even once to the temptation
of self-abuse.</p>

<p>Those of you who have not had proper instruction
in the care of the sex organs and felt
the irritation so much that you relieved yourselves,
don’t think about the past; don’t worry,
don’t read the scare-books and the advertisements
of the Quacks.</p>

<p>Keep a clean body and a clean mind. But
you cannot keep a clean mind if you allow the
accumulation of secretions to remain anywhere
in your system. The mind can be cleaned
just as well as the bowels or penis. You
can flush the brain so that nothing but pure
thoughts and right thinking flow through it.
This is done by good reading, good desires and
a constant study of yourself and what certain
impulses mean. Evil impulses WILL get
into the brain; flush them out. Look ahead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
never backward. No man ever succeeded in
life by looking behind himself. Look forward
in all things. Don’t worry and work yourself
ill by remembering the time when you did
give way to the desire; just try to think of
the times ahead that you will NOT.</p>

<p>Keep in your mind whatsoever things are
upright, just and manly. This does not mean
that you should be a “goody-goody” or a
“sissy.” No, these two specimens of half-boys
are detestable to all real men and women.
So are the other kind—the vulgar and vile.
Proper thoughts and clean acts in boyhood all
go to make a man of character, of honor, give
you the inward grace of a gentleman which cannot
manifest itself outwardly save in good
manners, modesty of bearing and fearlessness.
Let your mind be stored with evil thoughts,
indecent pictures made up in your mind, then
act upon all these foul things, and nothing can
bring you to the point of being a man and
gentleman. Never.</p>

<p>And the reason is this: The memory is
something like photographic films, like millions
of them, some exposed, some unused. Every
thought is registered on your memory films.
Every tiny brain cell is a film ready to take a
picture the moment it is exposed to a thought.
You can have a pile of bright, good, inspiring
ones so big and thick that they hide forever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
those films which have registered evil and
wrong thoughts.</p>

<p>Every debasing thought or waking dream
of filth leaves its photographic negative somewhere
in your brain. Every thought or mind
picture remains there to come forward again
and again, if it is not darkly and deeply hidden
by manly thoughts and ambitious dreams
of what you want to do to make something
of yourself and do something for the
world.</p>

<p>It is in these facts that the great injury of
self-abuse enters. You cannot commit the
vicious act without having in your mind some
kind of nasty and unnatural pictures. You
first bring this picture to your consciousness
which accompanies the act.</p>

<p>This picture you may think is only a passing
one, but it has left its negative in your brain.
It will stay there to some time reappear, unless
it is packed so far behind natural and manly
thoughts that it cannot possibly throw itself
before your consciousness.</p>

<p>From this explanation you can see that if
the habit of self-abuse and all the pictures in
your mind which accompany the habit are continued,
your brain cells will soon be occupied
by these negatives, and there will be a constantly
decreasing space for right thoughts.
Now comes the time when the youth finds it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
hard to apply himself to his work or studies.
His mind will wander; he is called stupid, he
becomes discouraged and leaves school or work.
Yet, he can, at this period in his life, be
brought back to be a normal youth. He can
start right by knowing that if he will at once
put all evil thoughts away he can hide the
brain pictures which have been holding him
down.</p>

<p>You should remember it is not so much the
PHYSICAL injury self-abuse does; not the
“losing a pound of blood” every time he
abuses himself; it is the brain power he is
weakening, the filling of brain cells with pictures
which shut out proper thoughts.</p>

<p>Of course it hurts your growing strength,
keeps you weak and finally affects your whole
nervous system, but the youth has wonderful
powers of recovery from PHYSICAL injury,
and if he has not kept up the habit, all this
injury may be repaired.</p>

<p>But not so with the brain. We cannot get
rid of the negatives there, but we can keep them
suppressed. And how well they may be hidden
and not allowed to shut out good thinking, depends
entirely upon the length and frequency
of the practice of self-abuse.</p>

<p>But one thing is certain: if the boy will at
once stop the habit, get away from all those
boys and things which bring out these injurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
brain pictures, he can forget the past and look
only at the future.</p>

<p>This is the cure and the only cure.</p>

<p>But there are a lot of details which, when
understood, help a boy to do all this. First,
never sleep with another person, man or boy.
In a former Chat I told you that to sleep with
another person was unhealthful; that it prevented
your skin from breathing fresh air
and that you could absorb the poisons from
another’s skin.</p>

<p>Sleeping with another person causes extra
warmth under the clothing; this affects the sex
organs—sends blood to them and causes a
feeling of attraction towards these delicate organs.
Often this will end in an emission—an
unnatural one, due to the heat, not to an effort
to empty overloaded sacks. Again, many boys
will be tempted to talk and play with each
other. These boys may be ignorant and innocent
at first, but in the end it means self-abuse.</p>

<p>Thousands of boys have been started on the
habit through sleeping one with another. One
may have been innocent and ignorant, one
vicious—no matter; the result is the same.</p>

<p>Never trust yourself in bed with a boy or
man. No matter if you are so situated that
there is only one bed to be had. Sleep on the
floor, anywhere; go without sleeping rather
than have that “first time” happen to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
And it is so easy to avoid all this danger
when you know the facts. The trouble has been
that these matters have been withheld from
your knowledge. It was so easy to tell you
to be good and then send you to bed with a
vicious boy.</p>

<p>There are things in trousers called men, so
vile that they wait in hiding for the innocent
boy. These things are generally well dressed,
well mannered—too well mannered in fact—and
pass as gentlemen; but they are really
human skunks hatched from rattlesnakes’ eggs.
They hang around fashionable summer hotels,
city boarding houses and hotels where families
live. They fool your mothers and sisters; are
always ready to play the gallant in parlor
games, croquet with the girls and often are
much sought after as dancers.</p>

<p>Look out for these vermin, be suspicious
of any man in trousers who avoids real men,
who never enters or takes interest in manly
sports, who tries to see you alone and prefers
to go in bathing with boys instead of men.
Don’t go to drive or walk with these things, for
all the time they are only waiting to teach
boys to help them in self-abuse or something
far nastier.</p>

<p>So never sleep with a man, except your
father. If you should be so situated that you
find yourself in bed with a man, keep awake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
with your eyes on something you can hit him
with. At the slightest word or act out of the
way, HIT him; hit him so hard that he will
carry the scar for life. Don’t be afraid, these
skunks are all cowards.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that you will never come
in contact with or know such beastly men.
There are not many of them sneaking around,
nevertheless I feel I should warn you against
everything that might be the commencement
of your ruin.</p>

<p>Almost all the deeds and thoughts which go
to make up a career of success or failure, have
their beginnings in youth. Youth is the springtime
of life. It is the planting time, the crop
you sow is reaped in the summer and autumn
of life.</p>

<p>Just being good amounts to a useless life
unless you can be good for something. You
cannot be good for anything unless you are
good to yourself. The time has passed
when a youth or man can neglect his body
and brain and, when they are no longer
working as they should work, go to a doctor
and have him repair the trouble with medicines.
The doctor of the future and those
of the present who understand man and his
powers, study to show you how to keep in the
best physical and moral health. These two
conditions cannot be separated; neglect your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
body and evil thoughts and weak will are sure
to follow. Both come from the Great Source
and both must be equally cared for and respected.</p>

<p>You have been told that it is wonderful to
look around and see God’s work. But this is
not exactly the whole truth. It is more wonderful
to study self and recognize the spirit
of God IN YOU. And this spirit in you will
always respond to your appeals for help in
these matters of taking care of the body and
all that belongs to the body.</p>

<p>Just say to yourself: “I have a lot of dirt in
my body; I know now how to get it out and
keep it out. I have some filthy thought germs
in my brain, I will wash them out and keep
them out.” Doing this until it becomes a silent
habit, you start as a youth whose foundations
are such that, as a man, you can become what
you will.</p>

<p>Boys have been scared to death, or to the
point where they think death would be a relief,
by being told that pimples on the face were
signs of self-abuse and the commencement of
“Lost Manhood.” Pimples on the face of a
growing boy have no more to do with these
conditions than a corn on the toe. Remember
this truth: Self-abuse kept up will, of course,
bring about a dirty complexion, pale face, trembling
limbs and the general appearance of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
wrong with the youth. But the purest-minded
and healthiest youth will have pimples
on his face for two or three years.</p>

<p>When the age of puberty arrives, every
gland, including the sweat glands of the face
and others, which exude a fatty material, are
pouring out an excess of their secretions, like
the sap in young trees during the springtime.
This state naturally leaves a complexion muddy-looking
and helps also to make pimples. But
the pimples on the youth’s face are mainly
due to another cause.</p>

<p>When the beard commences to grow, each
hair, in trying to push its way through the
tender skin, leaves a hole a little larger than
the size of the hair. Consequently there are
around the pushing hair of the beard little open
spaces into which dirt and some of the acid
secretions enter. This sets up a slight inflammation
and so, of course, makes pimples.</p>

<p>Let these pimples alone. All pinching,
opening and applications make them worse.
Sometimes a boy becomes so worried and
ashamed about them that he goes to a druggist,
who gives him an ointment or wash which closes
up the opening spaces and thereby keeps the
dirt and inflammation hidden for a time. But
this is an injurious thing to do; for soon the
inflammation increases downwards in the skin
and unless at once relieved the boy will have one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
form of a real skin disease, which, even when
treated by a doctor, is liable to leave scars on
the face; deep pits which resemble those of
smallpox. If you are foolish enough to smoke
cigarettes when growing, your pimples will be
irritated, and then, of course, enlarged and
more difficult for Nature—the only genuine
doctor—to bring about a good complexion.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the stronger the man you
are to be, the more numerous the pimples will
be on your face and body. This is because a
full and heavy beard generally belongs to the
strong man. So if you have more hairs pushing
through your skin than a less-powerful
youth, you will have more pimples. Temperament,
that is, your racial traits, color of hair
and family complexion, all these kinds of things,
of course, make a difference in the way your
beard grows and the quality of it; but the
principles are all the same for every growing
youth.</p>

<p>Frequently boys are frightened almost to
helplessness because some of these pimples appear
upon the parts surrounding the sex organs.
These pimples are generally from the same
cause; most often due to the curling of the
young hairs which re-enter the skin near the
point where they come out.</p>

<p>In all these matters you only need to keep
your face and other hairy parts clean by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
simple washing with soap and water. Use
only a plain, pure soap—castile soap is excellent
for this purpose. Don’t use highly-scented
soaps. Many of these are poisonous to such
conditions, as I have explained.</p>

<p>When you feel that it is about time to commence
shaving, do it yourself—DON’T “let
a barber do it.” It is an easy matter to learn
to handle a razor, and now the safety razors
make it inexcusable to go to a barber. Then
think of the nastiness involved in having a
stranger’s hands running all over your sensitive
skin! Would you let any other kind of
brush which had been used upon a thousand of
all sorts of human skins, be smeared over yours?
Then the soaps, towels, all the things the barber
uses! Ugh, if you had seen all the diseases I
have seen on men’s faces, you would allow no
hands but your own to touch your face. You
know where your hands have been; do you
know where the barber’s were a half-hour before
he shaved you?</p>

<p>True, all first-class barbers try to have
everything they come in contact with kept
clean and sterilized, but we cannot get away
from the fact that the razor, brush, soap and
hand of your own are far, far preferable to
use on your tender face. Then traveling, if you
do not shave yourself, you are liable to be
obliged to enter some barber shop from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
you come out diseased; perhaps diseased for
life. And if you do not know all about these
diseases they will get such a hold upon your
system that your career is ended. There are
many other good reasons why you should shave
yourself; one will come to your mind—the fact
that you save valuable time and can start out
in the morning looking clean and neat, as every
gentleman should and does.</p>

<p>In traveling and other conditions which keep
you away from your own toilets, especially in
the public schools, the seats of the closets are
often found to be covered with a form of lice—“crabs”
they are vulgarly called. When these
get on to you they cause a terrible itching.
They will become so irritating that you cannot
keep still. Many a boy has been sent home
from school because he could not keep still or
refrain from scratching himself. This form of
scratching has often been thought by his teacher
to mean evil thoughts or habits.</p>

<p>Poor fellows, how many of you have been
unjustly accused!</p>

<p>If you will examine yourself closely, you will
find the tiny lice. Little bits of things looking
like a black pin-point. The best thing under
these circumstances is to go to the doctor. He
will give you an ointment to apply which will
soon kill them. So don’t let some older boy,
through fun and the love of scaring you, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
perhaps through his own ignorance, frighten
you. Some boys and shameful men will tell
you that the itching is a sure sign of self-abuse,
or that you have a bad disease which will soon
rot your whole body. And as many boys have
once or more done things of which they are
ashamed—always a good sign is this shame—these
mean tales do much injury. There is
nothing in it, boys; just “crabs.”</p>

<p>It is every strange, little symptom which
comes to the developing youth that is seized
upon by the Quacks to exaggerate in their advertisements
and try to make you believe that
physical or mental ruin is right ahead of you—unless
you buy their drugs. Here is one way
they work upon the youth’s ignorance and
fears.</p>

<p>You are just an ordinary boy; full of fun,
play and no better nor worse than the rest of
us. One day you receive a circular or booklet
through the mail. There is no printing on the
envelope. Just one of the catalogues or circulars
you sent for, as you wanted to see the
prices of bats and mitts for next season’s games.</p>

<p>So thinks your mother also. And your
father? Well, he is too busy making money
for you all to really know what his son needs
and wants in the way of confidential talks. But
you will know when you have a boy—I am sure
of this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>But let us get back to the circular. You
open it and at the first glance of the heading,
down it goes deep into your pocket while you
sneak off to read it.</p>

<p>I say sneak off, because that is about what
you do. Then you read in the circular what
your awful doom is to be. As you read on you
tremble, and there comes over you the feeling
that every bit of real life is leaving you. Once
again you read those cursed lies and then
commences the habit of looking in the mirror
when no one is around, to notice your pale
face and those tell-tale pimples. You feel
your pulse, which is, of course, now going at
a rapid rate, and get into exactly that fright
the fakers knew you would get into and so
send them money for their “cure” of “Lost
Manhood.”</p>

<p>If I could have my way, I would send to
prison for life every criminal who advertised
or sold stuff for “Lost Manhood Restored.”
These vampires are criminals, soul-murderers
and body-destroyers, and just as guilty as
though they stuck a knife into every youth
and boy.</p>

<p>Then you read in the circular about the
awful effects and signs of “Seminal Losses
at Night,” and know for certain that they are
fast telling on your face. “Surely,” you say
to yourself, “I must show how rapidly I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
failing, for someone has noticed it and sent
to these doctors to have them tell me what
to do. Oh! what shall I do; can I ever be
cured?”</p>

<p>Poor, scared and suffering boy! Why have
father, mother and teacher left you to be the
prey of these criminals? Ask them!</p>

<p>No, these blood-suckers did not get your
name from anyone who knew you; that is, in
the way you think. This is the way the names
of boys and youths are procured: All through
the land, especially in the weekly papers which
circulate in the country towns, are to be found
advertisements saying that if you will send
your name—“only send your name; no money
is wanted” is the general way they put it—you
will receive the catalogue of the goods
these advertisers have to sell. Sometimes it is
some form of puzzle you are to solve and get
a prize—“Just send us your name,” that is the
trick. Others will offer you “A gold watch,
18-carat,” if you send a list of your young
friends who would like to earn a little money
selling soap, or canvassing for books or journals.</p>

<p>Rarely it is a fake sporting-goods house
which advertises to send catalogues if you will
send a list of names. But you all know the
real ones; these are honest, absolutely straight
houses. When you send these reputable houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
your names they are safe from being bought by
these quacks and criminals.</p>

<p>All these advertisers want is to obtain the
name of every boy and girl between fourteen
and eighteen years of age, so as to mail them
their circulars. Some of these advertisers are
the firms selling the “Lost Manhood” fakes
and other nasty fakes; some are in the disreputable
business only to get the names and
sell them to the blood-suckers, and once they
get your name, they will follow you up to the
last minute of your youth; then, if you have
been easily bled, they will follow you up into
your married life.</p>

<p>They work the Sunday School teachers by
offering to send samples of mottoes or some
other tempting bait to catch the unwary young
woman who has a class of boys—yes, and girls.
All they want is the name of each scholar
for some contest—the winning class to get a
prize; or else it is to introduce some new line
of CHURCH work—and to introduce it in their
city, samples will be sent free to each pupil.</p>

<p>In the high schools, they have their own
agents—pupils—who send a list of names and
with these names other information that these
scorpions want. Of course, many of these
pupil-agents do not really know just all the
evil they are doing, but I think they are generally
those of bad and injurious habits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>So when you receive one of these circulars
just tear the vile thing up and say to yourself:
“Nixy for me, I don’t bite at such bait—I’m
no sucker.”</p>

<p>I am pleased to say that all these nefarious
schemes I have investigated are run by foreigners;
not one I know of is controlled by a
genuine American or Britisher.</p>

<p>“But,” you say, “some of these fakers and
quacks must be honest. There must be something
in what they say in print, because they
offer your money back if you are not cured.
They give you a written guarantee and refer
you to a bank.”</p>

<p>True, and you will find that the guarantee
is legally correct and binding. But—</p>

<p>This is the way they trap you: In the guarantee
they promise to return your money—and
sometimes more as a bait—IF YOU GIVE
REASONABLE PROOF THAT YOU
WERE A VICTIM OF INJURIOUS
HABITS BEFORE TREATMENT, AND
THAT THE TREATMENT HAS NOT
CURED YOU.</p>

<p>When you demand your money back they
will send you a blank to fill out and return.
They inform you that when this blank
is properly filled out they will at once
return the money. I presume they will,
but I have never heard of such a case and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
I have investigated hundreds of these
schemes.</p>

<p>The blank you are asked to fill out is such
that no victim will return it. It requires you to
get the signatures of your minister, one of the
principal business men in your town and your
father or next of kin, certifying that you had
the habit before taking treatment and that
you have it now. Then this must be taken
before a notary and witnessed—the blood-suckers!</p>

<p>If you have any reason to think that you
may be in danger of falling into the habit of
self-abuse, do this: Every time the temptation
comes to you go at once and bathe your
sex organs in cold water. If it is in one of
those half-waking conditions in the morning,
WAKE UP. Go at once and plunge the parts
in cold water. Take a cold shower, if possible;
if not, have a big sponge always ready and let
the cold water run down your back and all
over the sex organs—testicles and penis. If
the temptation comes at night before you have
gone to sleep, get out of bed <em>at once</em>, no matter
how cold it is, the colder the better, and apply
the icy water.</p>

<p>Take cold? Not a bit of it. These are old
women’s tales; what all boys need are the true
facts of life from men. You want to be stopped
from being cuddled up in warm blankets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
told not to get out of bed, and all that nonsense.</p>

<p>While you are breaking up any impulses to
do that which you know is injurious, is the
time for developing the will. This can be done
by all boys and bring you to a state of self-control
that has been sadly lacking in the past
generation.</p>

<p>If you want big muscles, those always
under your control and acting when and how
you want them to, you exercise them regularly.
Those which have the least development and
are not under ready command, you pay much
attention to strengthening and bringing under
control. By this way you soon get them under
<em>full</em> control. The will can be made to do as
you desire, by the same method. When the
temptation comes, and as you are pouring over
the cold water, just say: “Will, do as I want—Take
my mind off these subjects. Will, drive
out that dirty picture—That’s the way, now,
once more.” If the thoughts still linger and
try to throw down the struggling will, stay up
reading some interesting book. Some exciting
book that you really like, something about
pirates, Indians, detective stories or travelers’
tales. I think it is a good thing to have always
on hand a book you want to read. Keep such
a book for emergencies, just as a soldier carries
bandages for emergencies. When a thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
or impulse comes to you that may carry you to
wrongful acts, jump out of bed and get the
book and read, even if you stay up all night.
This helps to strengthen the will and takes you
safely over the danger point. You may call
such a book: “The First Aid to the UNinjured.”</p>

<p>By these many little methods you gradually
develop the will to act your way. You do more,
you strengthen it, make it a BIG power for
you to move and direct and finally DO BIG
THINGS. The will certainly can be brought
to a high development, and what a magnificent
sight is the man with big muscles, big brain
and controlled will force.</p>

<p>Of course you cannot do all this at once. Do
not be discouraged if you fail time after time.
Stick at it. Every EFFORT means an increase
of power. It is like the gradual development
of the muscles, as I have said. You
all know the story of the man who commenced
to carry a calf and lifted it every day until it
had grown to be a cow. Then he could lift
and carry off the cow. Do you suppose he
could at first have lifted a cow? Of course
not. Neither can you carry off the first attempt
of your will to get the better of you. But
by keeping at it and doing a little every
day, in time you can get a strangle-hold
on it. When you get this hold call to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to get up and OBEY. It will do your
bidding.</p>

<p>You need no drugs, medicines or “electric
belts” to get you to full manhood. Just the
power in you well brought out is the way to
complete physical and mental development.
And again, don’t get discouraged. Man never
succeeded in anything by remembering past
failures. It is just this constant fighting discouragement
and mistakes that shows where the
faults lie, and knowing these faults, we can in
the next attempt avoid some of them, finally
all of them.</p>

<p>I have mentioned “electric belts.” These
are another great fake, a monstrous fake, and
if the people were not ignorant of the facts I
have been telling you, such frauds could not
live a day. You have all seen those pictures
in the papers of the big, strong-looking man
to whose arm clings a smiling young woman.
Then there is the companion picture, the
picture of the “down and out” man looking
as if he had one foot in the grave and one
hand reaching out to the insane asylum. Of
course the advertisement tells you that this
is the way he looked before he used the “electric
belt.” If it were not for the curse of these
pictures and the great injury they do to the
ignorant people, these advertisements of “electric
belts” would seem roaringly funny to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
doctor. The fact is that all the statements
in these advertisements and similar ones are
nothing but bare-faced lies—every one of them.</p>

<p>Again you say, “I know a man who was
cured by one of these ‘electric belts.’” Or a
youth will state that he wore one for three
months and was made into a well man again.</p>

<p>Both these statements are probably true, and
will be given in writing to the advertisers who
challenge the world to dispute the facts.</p>

<p>But how, then, if these advertisements are
frauds? Let us take a part of the advertisements
and discover:</p>

<p>After telling you that “Weaknesses, Nervousness,”
and all that kind of advertising rottenness,
will be removed by wearing the belt,
this advice follows: I quote word for word—“No
drugs to be taken, NO CONDITIONS
IMPOSED EXCEPT THAT DISSIPATION
MUST CEASE.”</p>

<p>Now you see the nigger in the woodpile—“DISSIPATION
MUST CEASE.” In
other words, stop your evil habits, the ones
which have caused a little or great weakness,
and you will be cured.</p>

<p>Is this any different from what I have told
you? Not at all, only I say <em>don’t use</em> the fake
“electric belt,” and you will be far better off.
Using these belts or any kind of appliances, is
worse than useless because they give you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
false idea of what really cures you, and you
may be foolish at some later period in your
life—but not if you have developed the will—and
resume your injurious habits, thinking all
you need to be well again is to resort to the
“belts.” You might just as well tie a piece of
lead pipe between your legs.</p>

<p>Some boys have been told they should wear
suspensory bandages all the time they are
growing. No; if Nature intended the testicles
should have greater support, she would have
given this support.</p>

<p>There are times in athletic sports, such as
wrestling, jumping, hurdling, pole jumping,
when it may be advisable, in order to save
the organs from shock or strain, to wear a
“jock strap” or suspensory bandage. But if
you have taken decent care of yourself, the
muscles which suspend the bag should be strong
and elastic enough to protect the testicles in it.
Cold water, again, is the best and only way by
which these muscles should be developed.</p>

<p>Frequently the boy imagines he has varicose
veins of the testicles—that is, another scare has
been thrown into him by the advertisements of
quacks—and such a lad will worry himself to
a state of uselessness. He is constantly feeling
the worm-like cords and attachments inside the
bag. He is sure now that it is all over with
him, he can play no more ball, but must sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
quietly and await the awful operation, or else
he goes to some drug store for a suspensory
bandage. If not warned and cared for in time,
he gets into the talons of the Quacks who bleed
him for all he can beg or get otherwise, and
when he can give them no more money he is
cast off hopeless, and we find him in the hospital
clinic a trembling, wasted youth. And
there was nothing the matter with him except a
big scare.</p>

<p>Such a fright lowers the whole tone of a boy,
moral as well as physical. His muscles become
weak and flabby. Now it is a scientific
fact that whatever part of the body your mind
dwells upon will show the effect, evil or good,
according to the kind of thoughts. Such a boy
as we have described, has his mind fixed upon
those worm-like cords in his bag. Now the
muscles relax, then he feels those “worms” so
big that the fright increases to almost a mania.</p>

<p>And all this suffering of thousands of lads
just because parents and teachers have been
criminally silent! But, boys, as I told you, it is
not fair to put all the blame upon our parents.
In their days they were not allowed to read
such books as you are now <em>directed</em> to read;
and such Chats as I am giving you—well, I
should be elsewhere than here, had I lived in
those days.</p>

<p>Never worry about those “varicose veins.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
You can <em>all</em> feel worm-like cords if you try.
Especially if you wait until some warm day or
after some great fatigue when the tiny muscles
of the testicles are relaxed.</p>

<p>That’s all there is to the whole matter, but
if you <em>do</em> worry about these and the other matters,
the fakers “will get your goat,” and when
that has left your side, like the horse, you lose
your race.</p>

<p>Perhaps many of you do not know what I
mean. Well, let us close this Chat by explaining:</p>

<p>It is the custom among racing stables in
England to have some little pet kept in the
box stalls with the horses. These highly-bred
horses are very sensitive and timid. They have
been accustomed to always have around them
and in their stalls, when sleeping, boys and
pets. Fox terriers and other small dogs of a
sporty nature are generally found sleeping with
the horses, sometimes on the horses’ backs, or
if it is cold, between their legs. Take away
for a night one of these pets and the sensitive
horses will not sleep, lose their appetite and
generally get out of form.</p>

<p>Now a few years ago there was a famous
horse being made ready to win one of England’s
big races. He had for a box-stall companion
a billy goat. The goat and horse had been
together since both were youngsters. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
well known that the horse was uncontrollable,
would neither eat nor sleep, if the goat was
away from the stall. So some mean man who
wanted the horse to lose the race, made the
stable boy drunk and then took away the goat.</p>

<p>All night that poor horse stamped and whinnied
for his goat. In the morning he was a
nervous wreck and would not touch his food.
Nevertheless, he was sent to the race and, of
course, lost it because he had “lost his goat.”
Another fellow “had his goat.”</p>

<p>So you see what I meant by using this slang
of the day. The fakers first get your goat—your
WILL and COURAGE—then you are
bound to lose the race of Life.</p>

<p>Keep your goat by and in you always.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>YOUR VOCATION AND HOW TO FIT YOURSELF FOR IT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>You will now see that a perfectly-balanced
and well-cared-for body is necessary to produce
a clear-thinking brain; that it is impossible to
bring out the best in you unless you have the
best of tools with which to work. No machinist
would think of trying to do good work
with dull, rusty or weak tools, and the most
valuable tools of all are those which we are
endowed with—hands and brains.</p>

<p>The boys in the past—many of the UNsuccessful
men of to-day, though not by any means
through their own fault—were brought up
under a false idea of democracy. Matters were
not as well understood as they are now, and
the progress made all goes to benefit the
boys of to-day. There is a fairly good reason
why we have had so many dissatisfied youths
in the past who are the failures to-day. It is
because these men as youths were never fitted
for the work in the world they could best do.</p>

<p>The error was in the false idea of the
teachers that all boys’ brains were made of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
same workable stuff, and all that was necessary
was to give to each and every boy the same
teaching and then turn him loose to try to
make a happy career.</p>

<p>Of course in many, too many cases, there
was nothing the boy could find to do that meant
anything to him. He could hang around corners,
smoke cigarettes and hear stories and
words of injury to any healthy youth. He
could find some job in a store or perhaps office
work, but fitted for real work and happiness
in that work, he never was. Such a boy had
really wasted valuable time in school, and it
was not strange that when he left school he had
no sense of the value of time. And such a boy
often left school with an idea that he was not
as bright as some other boys; this was the commencement
of a state of discouragement all
through his life—the reason he felt himself a
failure.</p>

<p>Yet all these unfortunate lads were the
equal of those who had graduated with high
honors in Latin or history, only the things
they could do best had never been given them
to do.</p>

<p>If a boy disliked Latin or history and could
not come up to the teacher’s idea of the interest
he should have in these studies, he was too
often considered lazy or stupid. If that boy
was interested in mechanical drawing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
happy in such work, no matter, he MUST
do his Latin, and disliking it, he, of course,
neglected it.</p>

<p>This line of treatment went on throughout
the boy’s school-life if he attended a public
school, and generally he left disgusted and untrained
for anything. Then he found there was
really no place for him in the world, nothing
but some small clerkships or other uncongenial
work, and being continually dissatisfied, of
course, never made a success in anything—just
a living. As he grew older such a youth soon
dropped into habits of drinking, or worse habits,
worked like a machine day in and day out, not
much caring how things went, so long as he
received his weekly pay envelope.</p>

<p>The thousands of men of this kind with
whom I have talked, were discouraged from the
start. As boys they were always blamed for
being useless, when, in fact no efforts had ever
been made to make them useful.</p>

<p>With you boys of the present day all this is
to be different. Every one of you can now
find education and training in what you are
fitted to do. Ideas are rapidly changing, as are
methods. You are aware by this time that
vocational schools are being rapidly established,
and I hope to soon see the day when all academic
high schools are retained only for those
who are going to college and from there to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
professional schools. Of course you should
all go to a high school, but to a high school
where the foundation for some practical vocation,
trade or business career is thoroughly
taught.</p>

<p>I am frequently asked by young men, “Do
you advise me to go to college?” The answer
is easily understood when I say: “Never be
SENT to college.” Here is where much of the
harm has been done—the boy has been sent to
college when in reality he WANTED, or
needed, to go to some institution where his
particular talents could be trained. For we
each and every one are born with SOME particular
talent, something in us which makes us
able to do a certain thing better than the other
man. If we were all equal in the matters of
thinking and doing,—that is, if we all did the
same thing,—how far would the world progress?</p>

<p>So this brings us down to the question, what
is the basis for success? What is it the boy
needs to progress every day in the trade or
vocation he has chosen?</p>

<p>I have already told you, but purposely repeat
it, NO BOY OR MAN CAN BE A
SUCCESS UNLESS HIS HEART AND
COMPLETE INTEREST ARE IN HIS
WORK. The most difficult part of the problem
is at the beginning. Your father or mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
wants you to be a lawyer or minister, your
teacher says you have great talent for a medical
career, but you do not care for any one of
these professions. You find it hard to really
know just what to do, and I sympathize with
you all. I think that those who see you from
the outside, who look upon you just as a real
boy and have no such relations to you as
parents or teachers, are in fact the best judge
of what you are capable of being fitted for
in a life’s career. Go and advise with some
successful man who knows you in your play
and daily life, but do not take his advice if it is
something HE likes and you detest. You will
soon have to be your own master, and now is a
good time to commence. But fit yourself for
something, you MUST. Notice how everything
around you is fitted by nature and then
trained by man, to do its work. The bulldog
is not taken out in the field to nose for game;
the draft horse is not taken to the trotting
track; the canary bird is not trained to catch
eagles. No, each and every kind has its special
work to do in making the world go around,
and each of us has to be trained according to
our talents. Just because we all have two legs
and arms does not indicate that we are all the
same—just human beings all turned out from
the same mold. Arms are made for one man
to use them in a certain line of work that another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
man cannot, with success, use his. And
so on.</p>

<p>Every man who has trained his particular
talents to their highest point and then strives
to widen them, is an aristocrat—a prince,
whether he is a brick-layer or lawyer. He only
sinks to the level of a commoner who has
neglected that working stuff which is in him.
And he does not neglect this if he is happy in
his work, or rather, if it is pleasure instead of
work.</p>

<p>This does not mean that all the preparatory
work will be congenial or without real labor.
No, much of the work that you have to do
preliminary to that which is to bring you success,
will be HARD work—plugging work,
full of disagreeable details, but all necessary to
build the foundations.</p>

<p>The dirty, muddy work involved in digging
for the foundation of some building that will
be a pride to its architect, is disagreeable, but
the architect must see that this work is properly
done; must get right into the mud and dirt
himself to know that every detail he has worked
out is being rigidly followed. If the designer
of the useful and beautiful building did not
have constantly in his mind the results of all
this digging, he would be a failure, he would
never be a designer and builder of magnificent
works for the future generations to admire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>It is just so with everything you start out
to do. Start out with a high purpose and the
common-sense idea that you HAVE to learn
all the details first—to do the digging before
that purpose can be fully carried out.</p>

<p>Concentration, constant concentration upon
your goal is the only rule to follow. Like football,
you move toward the goal by punting,
touchdowns, and penalties which put you back,
but you have ever one end in view—to reach
the goal. A willingness to take all the hard
knocks and throw-downs with the mind’s eye
fixed on the goal, is the kind of stuff which wins
out.</p>

<p>Never be a quitter.</p>

<p>Concentration is absolutely necessary to get
the power out of you and force it to do its
work. As someone has said, if you will concentrate
the rays of the sun by the means of a
magnifying glass you can burn a hole in almost
anything. If you focus all your forces on
one thing you can do wonders.</p>

<p>Don’t be a scatterer.</p>

<p>You do not all want to be mere office clerks,
bundle wrappers, or what is far worse for your
future, mere political petitioners hanging on to
your job by petty and ofttimes crooked work.
No, be something, do something that means a
future for you.</p>

<p>“But,” you say, “how do I really know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
I want to do, how can I find out for myself
what my future SHOULD be? You say not
to always follow the advice of successful men
if such advice does not agree with my ideas of
what I should like to do.”</p>

<p>Yes, here is a difficulty. Let us see if we
cannot solve it.</p>

<p>Don’t make the mistake so many thousands
of boys have made in the past, of confusing
what you would LIKE to BE with what
you are CAPABLE of DOING. Here is
where so much of the trouble has arisen. You
have in your mind, as an example, the success
a young man is making in writing for the
magazines and papers. You remember him
when he was a youth and you were a small boy.</p>

<p>His success has stimulated you, and you
think that you will be a writer or reporter.
Now the ambition is all very well, you have
made up your mind what you WANT to be,
but, and here comes the problem: Are you
fitted by nature, temperament and TALENT
for such work? This is a matter you must
solve for yourself, at least at first.</p>

<p>If you have done any writing at school, been
connected with the school’s paper, or in any
way found more pleasure in writing than you
have in mathematics, more fun in reading than
in loafing, real pleasure in putting together
words and sentences so that they really sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to you, then you probably have the talent for
the hardest vocation or profession in the world—journalism
or literature.</p>

<p>If all this is well proven to you—if you feel
that you MUST write—then all the hard work
at first will be willingly accepted. If the
drudgery, petty details of learning the art of
writing, is disagreeable, then it shows that
while you have perhaps a desire to see your
work in print you really have not the inborn
talent.</p>

<p>Now we come again to that question, “Shall
I go to college?” If you are going to make
a strenuous attempt to become a writer, the
answer is yes, by all means. Even if after
leaving college, and after a year’s trial at newspaper
work, you find the petty details disagreeable
and determine to drop the work, the college
experience will be valuable to you, for your
tastes show that in some line of intellectual
work, you will be a success. And you will
finally drop into just the vocation you are intended
for, and finally make good.</p>

<p>If the inclinations of your tastes are towards
mechanics, or electrical engineering, if every
bit of your studies at the high school where
language, literature or logic was a disagreeable
task—if you fairly hated such studies—don’t
think of going to a classical college.
In such a case what you need is a technical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
education. If you have the mechanical or
scientific mind a course at a technical school
puts you at once in the position to DO.</p>

<p>In art, music, literature, however, the situation
is somewhat different. Take the case of
one who desires to be a writer, and the facts
are the same for the other arts. A college
education will not make a writer out of anyone.
Most men could spend their whole lives
studying HOW to write, but in the end never
be ABLE to write. In other words, a college
education simply gives you the tools for writing
and shows you how to use these tools. The
tools for writing are such lines of reading,
thinking and verbal construction as education
gives you. Teaching you how to think clearly,
calmly and justly, is what the college does for
you. But if you have no original thinking
powers, of what use are all these tools to you?
You may have exceptional brain power, thinking
qualities, but not along those lines necessary
to make a successful writer, and so you
are at a loss to know how to apply the tools
given you. If you still struggle along in this
false position you soon sink to the hack writer,
the mind becomes clouded by failures and then
comes the “down and out” state too often seen
in those who have made the mistake of trying to
be what they could never be.</p>

<p>Let us take another case as an example of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
what I mean. You really have talent for wood
carving and finally decide that you will take
up this vocation—an admirable one. You
thoroughly understand that in order to become
a good wood-carver you must first learn to
use the tools, to know how to take care of them.
After this you must learn all about the different
kinds of woods, how they are prepared and
what effects the weather and climate have upon
them. When you have been through all this
preliminary work, there must come a study of
designs and the history of your vocation or
art. This is YOUR college education in preparation
for good work and the success good
work brings. You have been taught the use of
every detail which goes to make up a good
foundation for your career. You know HOW
to use the tools and everything else is now up
to you to make good. If your heart is in the
work you will surely win out.</p>

<p>You will be apt to hear a lot about the
cultural advantages of a college education; that
it is never amiss in any calling. But right
here comes a fact generally overlooked—you
can receive a cultural education along any line
you take up, and the better you apply yourself
to your vocation, the better will your culture
be.</p>

<p>In wood carving, for instance, there is much
along the lines of art, painting and sculpture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to be learned. Such progressive work may
lead you to become a famous sculptor or decorator
of the highest order. If you have wasted
your time along the cultural lines needed for a
writer or doctor, learned how to use their tools,
but do not possess their mental equipment,
failure is certain. The failures come from
mental dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Get out of your minds the idea that there
are only three or four professions which bring
position and respect. This is a great mistake
and is the cause for many poor doctors, the
hordes of unscrupulous lawyers and weak-kneed
ministers.</p>

<p>Many of these failures would have been successful
as carpenters, machinists, draughtsmen
or contractors. But they all wanted to go or
were pushed into holes they could not fit.</p>

<p>Remember the old saying, “A round peg
will not fit into a square hole.”</p>

<p>A trained machinist, one who takes delight
in his trade, can rise far higher in worldly goods
and the respect of his fellow-men than ever can
a half-contented doctor. It is the same with
an electrician, bridge worker, house painter, any
and all trades where the man has learned to use
his brain-tools and keeps sharpening them on
the grindstone of pleasure.</p>

<p>Don’t go into law or medicine unless you go
into these professions for the love of the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
You may not know it, but the income of the
average doctor or lawyer is not that of even
the paper-hanger or bricklayer. If you are
determined to be a doctor for the love of the
profession and the great good you can do—and
most of you will have to do it free for the needy
and poor—then you will be happy and also
probably poor.</p>

<p>In law, medicine, or the ministry, a college
education is absolutely necessary, both cultural
and preparatory. If a doctor, you must spend
four years at the medical college, a year or two
in the hospitals, then finish by visiting the clinics
of Europe. By the time you are thirty years
of age you are <em>fitted</em> to step into line with the
best doctors.</p>

<p>And unless you can do all this—and it takes
a lot of money—KEEP OUT. The days are
passing when the boy can go from the high
school to some cheap commercial medical college
and take any kind of a stand among the
educated doctors and the now enlightened communities.
There is plenty of room in the world
for the kind of a doctor I have first described,
but absolutely no places waiting for the latter
kind. These are not doctors, just medical
warts, the sort of quacks we had a shot at in
our last Chat.</p>

<p>The boy who has business talents and tastes
will, of course, be far better able to rise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
command positions if he possesses an education.
But don’t make the mistake of thinking that a
college education, just because it is a college
education, will make a business man of you
from the start. Of two boys having equal
business talents the one whose mind has been
trained to think and who has mixed with all
sorts of fellows at college, will probably have
advantages for getting along that the non-college
boy does not possess. But unless your
father or someone back of you has money to
spare, I believe that the average boy with
commercial instincts does better in the end by
getting into business early in life. He gets a
better fitting for his career.</p>

<p>Now I think you can readily understand the
first rule for becoming a successful man. Find
out what your talents are, then fit yourself so
that you can utilize all these talents. There are
schools now being established where every boy
can have this done. But he must work with
pleasure. If you find you have made a mistake
in your choice—and you will know this by
being constantly dissatisfied—get out and try
something else. Keep trying until you find
some vocation or trade which you go at with
increased pleasure every day. When this state
of mind has arrived you have found yourself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>ENVIRONMENTS AND DISEASES WHICH RUST BRAIN-TOOLS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>We now reach the most important details
concerning the keeping of the brain in activity
and vigor. Having brought you to an understanding
of the body, how to take care of it, of
all that belongs at the start to make up a successful
man, we must put ourselves in a position
to know how to live and act so that throughout
adult life and up to the age of many years, but
not old age, we can get out of us all that is
possible.</p>

<p>I speak of living many years, but not getting
old. I mean exactly what I say. There
is no reason why a man should be old at sixty,
no, not at seventy. I do not imply that a man
should be able to do the same amount of
physical work at seventy that he can at thirty,
but I do mean to say that all his mental forces
should be under his control at seventy years of
age, although he will naturally have to use them
with care. A man who has not injured his
brain forces should retain them up to the last
moment of his life, but as he has not the repairing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
powers of the younger man, he should
be careful of the strain put upon them.</p>

<p>In this latter fact lies the only difference.</p>

<p>Having started well in your vocation, trade
or profession, with your fine brain-tools edged
to their best, you may now proceed to success
or gradual failure. For, of course, just having
the training and education does not mean that
everything else comes along your way. Not
a bit of it. In fact, you will find at first that
the care of the working instruments you now
have will take a good lot of self-control and
the formation of certain necessary habits.</p>

<p>It all depends upon how you keep your
brain-tools what your future will be. Whether
you neglect them once in a while so that they
have to be sharpened again, whether you leave
them to rust and finally become useless, whether
you lay them aside in good condition and take
them up again in perfect order, all these matters
go for success or failure. If it is only
occasionally you neglect the brain-tools, you
must remember that each new act of resharpening
them leaves a less keen edge. Resting
your brain, taking time to recuperate tired
cells and enjoying some kind of sport or pleasure
that is a benefit instead of an injury to
your thoughts, is necessary for every man.</p>

<p>These brain-tools I have been speaking of
are your powers of thinking correctly, creating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
doing, and the absolute integrity which must be
retained between the impulses of the mind and
the hands which respond to these impulses. The
engineer, the auto driver, the mechanic, the
draughtsman, the airman, the man who works
in perilous heights while constructing tall buildings
or bridges, must have perfect harmony
throughout all his body—brain, muscles, eyes,
ears. Let any one of these senses become unconsciously
dull through neglect of right living,
and the awful moment comes when an engineer
sends a train to wreck with its innocent passengers,
a tender pulls a lever a tenth of a second
too soon and lets down the derrick’s load
upon his fellow workers, or a chauffeur misses
the turn by a few inches and sends the auto
crashing over a precipice.</p>

<p>It is because these little matters of keeping
the brain in its best condition by attending to
details of living have not been thoroughly understood,
that we have so many unaccountable
accidents occurring every day. The knowledge
of man’s forces and how they are controlled
has not kept pace with his wonderful
mechanical and electrical discoveries, so we have
gone along with brain, instincts and training
well enough for handling the plow and side-wheel
steamboat, but not for the safe control
of the delicate and powerful machines of to-day.</p>

<p>For example: a young man who runs an auto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
goes one night to a dance where he breathes
foul air, smokes and drinks a little beer. He
returns late to his bed and rises early in the
morning to take out the auto for a speedy spin.
He knew the day before that he was to go with
a party of children and women for an early
drive. But what he did not know was that the
foul air, tobacco and beer would surely make
for less correct connection between his brain
impulses and the response from his muscles,
hands and arms.</p>

<p>Now all this little night’s pleasure, while
harmless enough perhaps in its way and certainly
harmless for a man who was to drive a
hack the next morning, was injurious for one
who needed every tenth of action between
brain and hand under absolute control. There
is coming a time when all these matters will be
taught as well as the combustion parts of an
engine.</p>

<p>In these details I am not referring to dissipation
as it is generally considered. We accept
without argument the injury such habits do—the
certain ruin which follows drink and all
that goes with that state. We take this auto
driver whom we are using for an example, as
a temperate man. And justly considered he is
one, but nevertheless he has by this apparently
harmless pleasure of one night, gone to work
the next day with the fine edge off his brain-tools.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
When the time comes for the most
accurate judgment and an immediate response
of hands to avoid the danger the brain sees,
there is a part of a second in delay, and then the
awful accident happens.</p>

<p>How did it happen? Those left alive cannot
understand. The right thing was done at the
right moment, so all think. The driver was a
careful young man, of good habits, temperate,
“never known to have been under the influence
of drink, and always trustworthy.”</p>

<p>To-day is the day of the brain worker, and
the man who lets the edge of his brain become
dulled is a danger to himself and whatever he
controls. And it is these little things which
dull the brain; matters of such little importance
in a man’s outward life that no one would
suspect the direful results.</p>

<p>You can no longer do as your fathers used to
do; we are living in a distinctly different age;
we are daily dealing with powerful forces
undreamed of in the past generation, and we
must make ourselves ever ready to handle these
forces.</p>

<p>There has been such a tremendous move in
mechanical devices the last twenty years that
this necessity of adapting our methods of living
so as to safely accomplish the things our brains
are called upon to do, has not been fully appreciated.
Take the case of an engineer who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
been on duty for twenty-four hours. The old
idea was that he simply became tired, that if
he could keep his eyes open, everything would
go all right. Now I have told you that fatigue
produces a poison in the body; so here we see
that when an engineer meets with an accident
it was not due to merely being tired, but because
his brain was being saturated with
poisons, and when the moment came to act
there could not be the ready response of hands
or arms to avoid the accident.</p>

<p>But one class of men and women have known
the absolute necessity of keeping the brain clear
of poison. This class belongs to the professional
circus people—trapeze performers, animal
trainers, riders. These individuals live an
ideally moral life. Not that they are any better
than the rest of us, but because they know
they have so to live in order to do their work.
It is a very old profession, perhaps the oldest
in the world, and experience, tradition, training
and marrying into their own class—a very important
factor—has brought about their unconscious
acceptance of the physically pure life.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly after a generation or two in
the use of our wonderful mechanical and electrical
aids for easier living, we shall all be
brought to the same method of grading our
habits. Those who have not the mental vision
to see this necessity will cease to enjoy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
world’s improvements. They will all become
victims of their own stupidity or foolishness.</p>

<p>Not only does all this danger in dulling our
brain-tools apply to the engineer, electrician,
airman, auto driver and the hundreds of other
active callings, but it applies also to the writer,
painter, musician.</p>

<p>In these latter professions the danger is to
the individual, but the result is the same—ruin
in the end. The writer loses his force, his biting
words; the painter shows a lack of his former
color-tone, the musician finds that his latest
work is severely criticised.</p>

<p>All these conditions may occur and yet the
creator of brain output still remain an average
man, not noticeably dissipated. In fact, he
may live a strictly moral life, yet show in his
prime a deterioration which neither he nor his
friends can explain.</p>

<p>This fact brings us to the point of explaining
the little and big factors which produce these
causes of failure.</p>

<p>It is some little break in the connection between
brain-cells that brings about the inability
to think and act without effort. When a task
is difficult to perform that is usually accomplished
without difficulty, you may know that
there is a temporary interruption somewhere
in the tiny fibers and cells of the brain. Something
has disturbed their normal action. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
either fatigue poison, the poisons from overfeeding
or underfeeding, effects of alcohol, tobacco,
or the foul air you have taken into your
system. Look into the matter and see what is
the cause. It is the state brought about by
some of these poisons which is at the bottom of
all these lapses of full control of self and
powers. The most frequent cause for this
condition is due to two factors—external surroundings
and mental absorption of injurious
suggestions and sights.</p>

<p>The external surroundings are most frequently
those of which the individual is not
fully cognizant. That is, they are constantly
at work doing their little injury day by day
until they have finally made an impression
upon the activity of the brain—dulled its keenness.</p>

<p>First of all these is the breathing of unfresh
air. Not the noticeably bad air found in tenements,
many shops and factories, but the air
into which are thrown the emanations of thousands
of all kinds and conditions of human
bodies. No matter how well ventilated, theoretically,
a big department store may be, the
air one breathes in it is certain to contain
poisons from well and diseased bodies. In
most department and other large stores much
attention is paid to ventilation, the best possible
methods are used. But these stores cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
regulate the personal hygiene of those thousands
who enter.</p>

<p>The man who is in the habit of daily and
nightly taking into his system nothing but fresh
air cannot remain a half hour amid the surroundings
of a crowded store without having a
headache and a general feeling of sluggishness.
Always having his brain free of poisonous
substances, he rapidly becomes affected with
the smallest amount. Living amid such atmospheric
surroundings keeps the man and
woman from doing their best. It is the same
with the thousands of men who work in shops
among hundreds of their kind; with the traveler
who has to sleep in our microbe canisters, the
sleeping cars; the theaters where continuous
performances go on, and worse than all the
commuter who twice a day takes in the poisons
swarming in the smoking cars.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to enumerate all
these unhealthful conditions we have to face
every day of our lives. They are here and
many of them cannot be changed as long as
man and woman herd like sheep, one after the
other, to the cities. Of course it would be an
ideal state if before entering these large department
stores, factories, etc., every man,
woman and child was compelled to strip and
have a hot bath and vigorous rub down. And
this idea is not such an impossible one as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
might at first think. These very same conditions
existed in Rome. There every man and
woman took a hot bath before and after being in
a crowd, whether it was shopping, in the Forum,
or the amphitheater. There were baths for
the poor, for the children and nurses, for the
laborer as well as those magnificent ones for
the rich and noble. But you see they were all
Romans. I don’t think we should have much
success in getting ALL of our citizens to bathe.
In the hospitals, we doctors sometimes have to
use a hose to get any effect upon a certain
class of patients. I have seen thousands of men
and women who wanted the doctor to give
them “something to make them feel well”
when plenty of soap and water was all they
needed. And they were not the poor, the
tramps and outcast, by any means.</p>

<p>I would go farther than the bathing before
entering a crowded place. I would have them,
after the shopping or factory work is over, pass
through a system of breathing exercises in the
open air—skin exposed—then allowed to go
their way.</p>

<p>But practically, what can be done? Get out
in the fresh air three or four times a day and
take breathing exercises. No matter what the
weather is, do this simple thing. At noontime
there is always opportunity for ten or fifteen
minutes of new life. Get it. No matter what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the weather is, always have your bedroom window
open. Better let the snow and rain come in
and spoil your carpet than allow the poisonous
air expelled from your or other lungs to re-enter
your system and dull your working
capacity. Do not forget what I have already
told you when speaking of athletic prowess—that
the skin is, next to the lungs, our greatest
breathing organ. Whenever possible, take an
air bath—in your room when the sun shines,
when you go bathing in the sea or swimming
“in the ole swimmin’ hole.”</p>

<p>NEVER take “headache powders.” The
habit of taking any kind of “nerve tonic,”
digestive tablets, “harmless bracers,” will in
the end put your brain-tools in poor shape.
You have now the knowledge of what health
means and how to keep it; if you will apply that
knowledge with judgment you will be taking
the best and only medicine man needs unless
a destructive disease attacks you. And here
is an important item; the ordinary diseases
man is afflicted with will not get a hold upon
the WELL youth.</p>

<p>I thoroughly appreciate the fact that all
boys must have some kind of recreation. The
working-boy needs it more than the schoolboy.
You cease to be a healthy youth when you do
not care for recreation, and fun, play and release
at certain intervals from all kinds of work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
is your birthright. But this recreation should
be taken in fresh air and with proper companions.
While speaking of fresh air I am
reminded of several letters from boys sent to
me after our last Chat. They asked about
the same question: “If my father or mother
died from consumption, is there any use of
my fitting myself for a trade if I am to have
consumption?”</p>

<p>We can settle this question in a very few
decided words. No matter if your whole family
died from consumption, it does not mean you
will have consumption. Consumption is not a
disease you can inherit. Now don’t forget
this truth. But if you are born of consumptive
parents it generally means that your parents
did not know the curative value of fresh air.
If you were kept in the same rooms where the
germs of tuberculosis lived and thrived you
ran big risks. But if you got away from these
conditions as soon as you knew the danger,
then, even if you have slight symptoms of the
disease, you can be assured of a complete cure.</p>

<p>FRESH AIR DAY AND NIGHT,
WITH NOURISHING FOOD AND
PLENTY OF IT, WILL KEEP YOU
FREE FROM CONSUMPTION. These
conditions will cure you in the first stages.</p>

<p>It is very important, however, that the boy
whose parents died from consumption should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
not follow any trade or vocation which keeps
him indoors during the growing period of his
life. He never should take up any employment
which means living in a dusty atmosphere,
where metal filings are floating in
the air. Keep out of button factories.
The dust from the old bones used to make
buttons and similar articles is apt to irritate
the lungs, and when this condition is brought
about the germs of consumption find a ready
soil to breed in, and they do so.</p>

<p>You need have no fear of consumption if
you follow the rule of keeping your lungs
clean; fresh air is the broom for this kind of
cleaning.</p>

<p>The curse of the public dance halls is not
known to you all. I do not speak of the immoral
conditions surrounding many of these
places, but of the physical conditions. You
cannot frequent these poorly-ventilated halls
without having poisons circulated in your
brains. If you are studying to perfect yourself
in some vocation which calls for a perfect
adjustment between the brain and hands; if
your work calls for the keenest eyesight or
acutest form of hearing; the edge will be taken
off these tools should you spend your nights
where the air is foul, where the skins of careless
and ignorant persons are giving off their
poisons, where the dust brought in by skirts is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
swirled in the atmosphere by the dancing
crowd.</p>

<p>There is no doubt in my mind that many
a boy is started on a career of “laziness,” incapacity
and unhealth from the constant intake
of poisonous matter always to be found up in
the gods’ gallery. Foul and hot air exhaled
from the lungs always rises upward, so a boy
sitting in the gallery really has his lungs over
a vast pit which sends up rank poisons for
him to take into his system. Indirectly this
leads to drink, for with a headache, a feeling
of weakness and sometimes a dizziness he, at
first, takes a little beer. From this to ale and
then liquor is the easy path. What can we
expect from the brain of such a youth? Nothing—that
is, nothing good. So at the start of a
useless boy and ofttimes criminal, we see it was
not vicious tendencies nor criminal instincts,
but vicious air which brought about a poisoned
brain and this results in a wrong view of things,
so the youth takes to anything but real work.</p>

<p>What the hookworm is to the unfortunate
troubled by this parasite, the air in the top of
the cheap theaters is to the boy and youth. It
is worse than the hookworm, for along with the
foul air he takes into his system go the fouler
suggestions of the stage.</p>

<p>Every evil suggestion, spoken or acted, works
great harm to your brain-tools. I do not intend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to say anything to you about the moral side of
evil—that is the Sunday School side—and I
want you to get this fact well in your minds.
I am trying to tell you what are the many
causes for not getting along, as well as about
those conditions of brain that will put you toward
success. To do so I have to warn you
about evil suggestions and companions. The
moral side of your life will be taken care of if
you avoid all those conditions which go to
make a weak brain and body.</p>

<p>If the girls who frequent the PUBLIC dance
halls were your equals, if they were fit to be
your future wives, I should have no objections
to your going there—provided the ventilation
was of the best. But you all know in your
hearts that you would not want your sister to
go to these PUBLIC dance halls, and that a
mother who brought up her daughters in the
right way would not allow them to frequent
such places and associate with strange men and
youths. There are a large number of girls who
frequent these places unknown to their mothers,
others lie to their mothers about these matters.
Now, you can put this down as a fact, a girl
who will lie to her mother and disobey her
will do the same to you if she becomes your
wife.</p>

<p>You know all this, I dare say, but I want it
deeply stamped upon your mind by one who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
had a large experience with these kinds of girls
and women. They are not wholly to blame, but
we will not go into this subject here.</p>

<p>Now if this is the solid truth, do you not see
that in these associations you are bound to see
and hear things which fill your mind with
thoughts and ideas which do not help your
mental growth; more, they injure it. It is the
same fact over again—the brain is a sensitive
photographic film.</p>

<p>When you go to dances see that the hall you go
to is well ventilated, that no smoking or drinking
is allowed and that those you dance with
are girls you can introduce to your mother and
sisters. For dances and fun you should have,
but see that they are of the sort that the next
morning when you take up your work nothing
evil enters your mind, that remorse and shame
do not crowd out the teaching of yesterday and
that you feel more ambitious to work to-day
than the day before. If this state of mind is
held day by day, you are certain to achieve
success. If the contrary state of mind takes
hold of you there is a going backwards, and
kept up, this state means FAILURE.</p>

<p>Then there are those nasty holes, the public
“poolrooms.” There is no objection to playing
pool, billiards or any games, but there is
objection to hanging around in the foul air—you
see I am at your health again—the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
cigarette smoke, and listening to the animal
language and ideas of the useless youths who
make these places their “hang-outs.”</p>

<p>Don’t hang around with “the gang” unless
you want later to hang with the gang.</p>

<p>The country boy needs this advice as much,
if not more, than the city boy. He more
frequently becomes fascinated by the evil attractions
which reach him than the boy who is
surrounded by good gymnasiums, teachers of
manual labor and open-air playgrounds. But
at heart he is a good boy.</p>

<p>There was a time when the boy who lived
on a farm was free from evil suggestions, associations
and shows. It is not so now. In fact
I believe the country boy has more temptations
thrust in his way than the city boy. He has
not been brought up to see the outside world
as has the city boy; hence, when these evils
reach his neighborhood, all is new and fascinating
to him. The trolley has penetrated his
district and established “White Cities,” dance
halls have been erected, moving picture shows
and other dubious attractions follow the trolleys
and are not always under the control of these
railways. I have seen picture shows at these
places which would not be allowed in the cities.
The country fairs have many side shows that
cannot but injure every youth who witnesses
them, but to explain where the injury comes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is never the duty of school-teachers or parents—at
least they will tell you so.</p>

<p>But we must not blame the country boys
for flocking to these shows. It is very tempting
bait held out for their dimes and nickels. The
boy’s life on the farm is devoid of many of the
harmless pleasures given to the city boy. There
are no places where he and his companions may
gather—no boys’ clubs, no gymnasiums. But
worse than all his parents seem to lack knowledge
of what such a lad needs in the way of
real instruction concerning life, of the dangers
of associating with the girls brought from the
cities to fleece and disease them, and to the
dangers around the “White Cities” and other
public places, which the most innocent lad is
liable to fall into.</p>

<p>These boys are to be pitied and not blamed
for their sad ends, for it is a fact that in the
country towns, especially in New England,
there are more useless youths than can be found
anywhere else in the land. The harvest of the
quacks is gathered from the country boys and
girls.</p>

<p>For the boy who is to stay on the land there
is but one thing to do. Farming being his
vocation, he must fit himself to get the best
out of his farm. This he can do by attending
an agricultural school. No matter if your
parents do scoff at scientific farming; you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
get out of the old rut and show them their
error. The boy must when he returns to the
farm during his vacation, realize that he is being
given brain-tools,—his education,—and not to
dull these delicate instruments he will have to
avoid all evil companions and shows. He can
demonstrate by this attitude that his mental
powers are developing and that he is ABOVE
those chaps who loaf around the store telling the
latest stories and of what they saw at “The
Pavilion.”</p>

<p>It is your duty, as a growing man, to set
this example. From a sense of duty it will
become a pleasure. It is only by such examples
we can save the thousands of country boys, for
many of them, perhaps most of them, will see
a new light and a future; something that has
not yet come into their vision. You will find
that taking a leading part in your community
will be far beyond any sport you formerly
found at the shows and dances, that you are
growing in mind, spirit and power. The boys
who refuse to follow your example will be
those whom you hire, when they are sober, to
cut your wood or pitch your hay. And all of
them will have had your opportunities.</p>

<p>To the boy who has wealth or knows he will
have it, there is little to say. If such a youth
does not use his wealth to develop his powers
to their highest degree and also assist in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
possible way the progress of the world, there is
nothing but universal condemnation. The world
to-day has no place for the mere spendthrift
and idler. A man of wealth has the right to
live as luxuriously and well as he likes, but
he has no right to allow his brain to sink to
nothingness or by example lower the thinking
powers of his fellow men. It does not make
much difference what kind of work a man of
wealth does, so long as WHAT he does aids
instead of hinders his fellow men.</p>

<p>Thousands of boys have been made into
MEN through the training they have received
in the navy. Most of these youths went from
homes where never a word of what should have
been told them was uttered. Especially so is
this true of the country boys. Their fathers
took a colt as soon as it was old enough and
commenced to train it, give it good manners
and see that it was kept from running wild and
with the mares. He took pride in daily making
it step lively and surely. He saw that its
food was of the best, and proudly drove it
around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>But his SON was allowed his own way,
never taught to keep in the right road, never
controlled, never confidentially considered. If
such a boy went into the navy, he received the
training needed, but which his PARENTS
would have neglected. Those who have received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the fatherly instruction of the navy have
been turned out well-mannered, given the best
of health and the knowledge of how to keep it.
And do not make the mistake too often made
that the navy takes unruly boys, those SENT
away from home or the riff-raff from the cities.
The navy will not accept such useless stuff.</p>

<p>If for no other reason I am a believer in a
bigger navy, for it seems to me the only way
we can control and bring to full and decent
manhood the thousands of neglected youths
throughout the land. Trained, having a vocation,
worldly-wise, but not evil or sneaking,
these youths are exerting a good example
wherever they locate after leaving the service.
They bring their brain-tools ashore with them
and use them, take care of them and know the
fearful results of an immoral life.</p>

<p>So I say to you boys who cannot decide
upon just what you want to do, yet know that
you must do something, try the navy. There
you will find several vocations from which to
pick and be trained in. You will obtain a
knowledge of the world, broaden your intellect
and secure perfect health. When you come out
you will be fitted to do something. If you
remain home hanging around, you will probably
end in being a helpless man—in more ways
than one.</p>

<p>Yes, helpless in mind and perhaps limbs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Why? Because the boy who goes through the
public schools and then out into the world runs
imminent danger of being ruined for life
through one fact—HE HAS NEVER BEEN
TOLD THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT
LIFE.</p>

<p>I have hinted in these Chats that there is
one factor that does more to injure man’s brain
and body than all the ordinary diseases in the
world. It is such a big factor in making or
unmaking man that I shall only point out here
the importance of knowing all about this disease
and other troubles following the disease.</p>

<p>This disease is sexual in its origin. Of course
you all know that venereal diseases exist. You
have heard about syphilis and gonorrhea. I
have classed them under one disease only because
they arise from one cause. Besides these
two there are many complications arising from
both.</p>

<p>Now what is the truth about these diseases?
Why should a boy, girl, everyone, know about
these fearful things if they intend keeping away
from the women who spread these vile troubles?</p>

<p>Just because the danger does not lie altogether
in those of evil habits and professions.
If the diseases were only caught by those who
lived immoral lives, and stayed with these people,
it would not be necessary to go into full details.
But these diseases do their great injury to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
innocent and ignorant—those ignorant of these
important matters.</p>

<p>The germs of these diseases are now everywhere—in
the schools, public drinking cups,
on hotel towels, on the lips of girls who freely
allow you to kiss them. They can be left by
the cook on the tasting spoon, are found upon
the seats of public toilets, on soiled linen, anywhere
man and woman goes and works to-day.
You may have your eyesight completely destroyed
by getting a few germs in your eyes
by rubbing your face on some apparently clean
towel. In fact, the ways you can contract these
diseases are too numerous to mention; you must
know them all.</p>

<p>The greatest fact for you to know is how
both syphilis and gonorrhea can ruin your
brain; gradually, but surely. If you have
had some of the germs of syphilis enter your
system through the lips by drinking from the
shop cup, or perhaps from kissing a good girl
who has a syphilitic sore on her lips from a
similar cause, deep into your system goes the
poison unknown to you until too late. Then,
if you don’t know the whole truth about these
matters, nothing can help you. Remember it
is ignorance of these subjects that does the
harm. If you know what a sore in the throat
means; if a pimple on the lips look suspicious
to you, then a full sense of what it MIGHT<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
be sends you to the reputable doctor and your
disease may be stopped from going further.</p>

<p>These are the diseases the quacks thrive
upon. These are the “Blood Diseases,”
“Kidney Troubles,” sores on the scalp and
body they advertise to cure. They know you
are ignorant of the real truths concerning these
awful diseases and they play up to that ignorance
and bleed you for all you are worth.
And when they get through with you there is
a general ruin of both your brain and body.</p>

<p>Not one of us can avoid the danger of contracting
these diseases; the germs are all around
us to-day. You must know all about them to
make you safe, your sister safe, your mother
from running the risk of giving it to the little
baby.</p>

<p>What, for pure, moral persons? Yes; these
are just the people who should be armored
against the plague. Knowledge will protect
them; ignorance will not.</p>

<p>Then there is a lot you should know about
the women who directly spread the plague.
You must know all these things if you are to
start in a career amidst life as it is to-day.</p>

<p>So important is all this subject and everything
relating to it that I could not, in these
Chats, go into the details. But I have written
them all down in plain language and have not
omitted a single fact about which you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
know. The little book is entitled, “PLAIN
FACTS ON SEX HYGIENE.”</p>

<p>I cannot thank you, boys, too much for your
interest in listening to me. I have, I know,
often repeated facts to you, and frequently
rambled and been somewhat discursive. But
remember these are CHATS, not studied
speeches whose every word has been picked for
its nicety. My heart has been always in what
I have said to you, and you know sometimes
when a fellow feels that way, he lets literary
style go hang.</p>

<p>In closing I want to repeat to you the oath
of the knights of old. I want you to take
to your hearts:</p>

<p>“Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
things are honest, whatsoever things are just,
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things
are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report;
if there be any virtue, and if there be any
praise, think on these things,—and do them, and
for them live and die.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
